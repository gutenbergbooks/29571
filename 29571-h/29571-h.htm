<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>FRONTIER DAY</h3>
</div>
<p>Lefever, if there was a table in the room,
could never be got to sit on a chair; and
being rotund he sat preferably sidewise on the
edge of the table. One of his small feet&ndash;&ndash;his feet
were encased in tight, high-heeled, ill-fitting
horsemen&#8217;s boots&ndash;&ndash;usually rested on the floor,
the other swung at the end of his stubby leg
slowly in the air. This idiosyncrasy his companion,
de Spain, had learned to tolerate.</p>
<p>But Lefever&#8217;s subdued whistle, which seemed
meditative, always irritated de Spain more or
less, despite his endeavor not to be irritated. It
was like the low singing of a tea-kettle, which,
however unobtrusive, indicates steam within.
In fact, John Lefever, who was built not unlike
a kettle, and whose high, shiny forehead was
topped by a pompadour shock of very yellow
hair, never whistled except when there was some
pressure on his sensibilities.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></div>
<p>The warm sun streaming through the windows
of the private office of the division superintendent
at Sleepy Cat, a railroad town lying almost
within gunshot of the great continental divide,
would easily have accounted for the cordial perspiration
that illumined Lefever&#8217;s forehead. Not
that a perspiration is easily achieved in the high
country; it isn&#8217;t. None, indeed, but a physical
giant, which Lefever was, could maintain so constant
and visible a nervous moisture in the face
of the extraordinary atmospheric evaporation of
the mountain plateaus. And to de Spain, on this
occasion, even the glistening beads on his companion&#8217;s
forehead were annoying, for he knew
that he himself was properly responsible for their
presence.</p>
<p>De Spain, tilted back in the superintendent&#8217;s
chair, sat near Lefever&ndash;&ndash;Jeffries had the mountain
division then&ndash;&ndash;his elbows resting on the arms
of the revolving-chair, and with his hands he
gripped rather defiantly the spindles supporting
them; his feet were crossed on the walnut rim
of the shabby, cloth-topped table. In this attitude
his chin lay on his soft, open collar and tie,
his sunburnt lips were shut tight, and above and
between his nervous brown eyes were two little,
vertical furrows of perplexity and regret. He was
looking at the dull-finish barrel of a new rifle,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
that lay across Lefever&#8217;s lap. At intervals Lefever
took the rifle up and, whistling softly, examined
with care a fracture of the lever, the
broken thumb-piece of which lay on the table between
the two men.</p>
<p>From the Main Street side of the large room
came the hooting and clattering of a Frontier Day
celebration, and these noises seemed not to allay
the discomfort apparent on the faces of the two
men.</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is warm,&#8221; observed Lefever, apropos
of nothing at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you get out of the sun?&#8221; suggested
de Spain shortly.</p>
<p>Lefever made a face. &#8220;I am trying to keep
away from that noise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang it, John,&#8221; blurted out de Spain peevishly,
&#8220;what possessed you to send for <i>me</i> to do
the shooting, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>His companion answered gently&ndash;&ndash;Lefever&#8217;s patience
was noted even among contained men&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;Henry,&#8221;
he remonstrated, &#8220;I sent for you because
I thought you could shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain&#8217;s expression did not change under the
reproach. His bronzed face was naturally amiable,
and his mental attitude toward ill luck, usually
one of indifference, was rarely more than one
of perplexity. His features were so regular as to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
contribute to this undisturbed expression, and his
face would not ordinarily attract attention but
for his extremely bright and alive eyes&ndash;&ndash;the frequent
mark of an out-of-door mountain life&ndash;&ndash;and
especially for a red birthmark, low on his left
cheek, disappearing under the turn of the jaw.
It was merely a strawberry, so-called, but an
ineradicable stamp, and perhaps to a less preoccupied
man a misfortune. Henry de Spain, however,
even at twenty-eight, was too absorbed in
many things to give thought to this often, and
after knowing him, one forgot about the birthmark
in the man that carried it. Lefever&#8217;s reproach
was naturally provocative. &#8220;I hope now,&#8221;
retorted de Spain, but without any show of resentment,
&#8220;you understand I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; persisted Lefever good-naturedly, &#8220;I
only realize, Henry, that this wasn&#8217;t your day for
the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door of the outer office opened and Jeffries,
the superintendent, walked into the room; he
had just come from Medicine Bend in his car.
The two men rose to greet him. He asked about
the noise in the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;That noise, William, comes from all Calabasas
and all Morgan&#8217;s Gap,&#8221; explained Lefever,
still fondling the rifle. &#8220;The Morgans are celebrating
our defeat. They put it all over us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
We were challenged yesterday,&#8221; he continued in
response to the abrupt questions of Jeffries. &#8220;The
Morgans offered to shoot us offhand, two hundred
yards, bull&#8217;s-eye count. The boys here&ndash;&ndash;Bob
Scott and some of the stage-guards&ndash;&ndash;put it
up to me. I thought we could trim them by
running in a real gunman. I wired to Medicine
Bend for Henry. Henry comes up last night
with a brand-new rifle, presented, I imagine, by
the Medicine Bend Black Hand Local, No. 13.
This is the gun,&#8221; explained Lefever feebly, holding
forth the exhibit. &#8220;The lever,&#8221; he added with
a patient expletive, &#8220;broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the gun, John,&#8221; interposed de Spain
resignedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll lay it on the track to-night for
a train to run over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a time limit, you understand, William,&#8221;
persisted Lefever, continuing to stick pins calmly
into de Spain. &#8220;Henry got to shooting too fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t what beat me,&#8221; exclaimed de
Spain curtly. And taking up the offending rifle
he walked out of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor was it the most humiliating feature of
his defeat,&#8221; murmured Lefever, as the door closed
behind his discomfited champion. &#8220;What do you
think, William?&#8221; he grumbled on. &#8220;The Morgans
ran in a girl to shoot against us&ndash;&ndash;true as
there&#8217;s a God in heaven. They put up Nan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
Morgan, old Duke Morgan&#8217;s little niece. And
what do you think? She shot the fingers clean
off our well-known Black Hand scout. I never
before in my life saw Henry so fussed. The little
Music Mountain skirt simply put it all over him.
She had five bull&#8217;s-eyes to Henry&#8217;s three when the
lever snapped. He forfeited.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some shooting,&#8221; commented Jeffries, rapidly
signing letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expected some when Henry unslung his
gun,&#8221; Lefever went on without respecting Jeffries&#8217;s
preoccupation. &#8220;As it is, those fellows have
cleaned up every dollar loose in Sleepy Cat, and
then some. Money? They could start a bank
this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds of revelry continued to pour in through
the street window. The Morgans were celebrating
uncommonly. &#8220;Rubbing it in, eh, John?&#8221;
suggested Jeffries.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it,&#8221; gasped Lefever, &#8220;to be beaten
by an eighteen-year-old girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that,&#8221; declared Jeffries, waking up as if
for the first time interested, &#8220;is exactly where you
made your mistake, John. Henry is young and
excitable&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excitable!&#8221; echoed Lefever, taken aback.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, excitable&ndash;&ndash;when a girl is in the ring&ndash;&ndash;why
not? Especially a trim, all-alive, up-and-coming,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
blue-eyed hussy like that girl of Duke
Morgan&#8217;s. She would upset any young fellow,
John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A girl from Morgan&#8217;s Gap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan&#8217;s Gap, nothing!&#8221; responded Jeffries
scornfully. &#8220;What&#8217;s that got to do with it?
Does that change the fire in the girl&#8217;s eye, the
curve of her neck, the slope of her shoulder, John,
or the color of her cheek?&#8221; Lefever only stared.
&#8220;De Spain got to thinking about the girl,&#8221; persisted
Jeffries, &#8220;her eyes and neck and pink cheeks
rattled him. Against a girl you should have put
up an old, one-eyed scout like yourself, or me,
or Bob Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another thing you forget, John,&#8221; continued
Jeffries, signing even more rapidly. &#8220;A
gunman shoots his best when there&#8217;s somebody
shooting at him&ndash;&ndash;otherwise he wouldn&#8217;t be a gunman&ndash;&ndash;he
would be just an ordinary, every-day
marksman, with a Schuetzenverein medal and a
rooster feather in his hat. That&#8217;s why you shoot
well, John&ndash;&ndash;because you&#8217;re a gunman, and not a
marksman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That boy can shoot all around me, Jeff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For instance,&#8221; continued Jeffries, tossing off
signatures now with a rubber stamp, and developing
his incontestable theory at the same time,
&#8220;if you had put Gale Morgan up against Henry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
at, say five hundred yards, and told them to
shoot <i>at</i> each other, instead of against each other,
you&#8217;d have got bull&#8217;s-eyes to burn from de Spain.
And the Calabasas crowd wouldn&#8217;t have your
money. John, if you want to win money, you
must study the psychological.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was abundance of raillery in Lefever&#8217;s
retort: &#8220;That&#8217;s why you are rich, Jeff?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am poor because I failed to study it.
That is why I am at Sleepy Cat holding down a
division. But now that you&#8217;ve brought Henry
up here, we&#8217;ll keep him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, keep him?&#8221; demanded
Lefever, starting in protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do I mean?&#8221; thundered Jeffries, who
frequently thundered even when it didn&#8217;t rain in
the office. &#8220;I mean I need him. I mean the
time to shoot a bear is when you see him. John,
what kind of a fellow is de Spain?&#8221; demanded
the superintendent, as if he had never heard of
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry de Spain?&#8221; asked Lefever, sparring
innocently for time.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Commodore George Washington, General
Jackson, Isaac Watts de Spain,&#8221; retorted Jeffries
peevishly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know the man we&#8217;re talking
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Known him for ten years.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then why say &#8216;Henry&#8217; de Spain, as if there
were a dozen of him? He&#8217;s the only de Spain in
these parts, isn&#8217;t he? What kind of a fellow is
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever was ready; and as he sat in a chair
sidewise at the table, one arm flung across the
green baize, he looked every inch his devil-may-care
part. Regarding Jeffries keenly, he exclaimed
with emphasis: &#8220;Why, if you want him short
and sharp, he&#8217;s a man with a soft eye and a snap-turtle
jaw, a man of close squeaks and short-arm
shots, always getting into trouble, always getting
out; a man that can wheedle more out of a horse
than anybody but an Indian; coax more shots
out of a gun than anybody else can put into it&ndash;&ndash;if
you want him flat, that&#8217;s Henry, as I size
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeffries resumed his mildest tone: &#8220;Tell him
to come in a minute, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain himself expressed contemptuous impatience
when Lefever told him the superintendent
wanted him to go to work at Sleepy Cat. He
declared he had always hated the town; and
Lefever readily understood why he should especially
detest it just now. Every horseman&#8217;s yell
that rang on the sunny afternoon air through
the open windows&ndash;&ndash;and from up the street and
down there were still a good many&ndash;&ndash;was one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
derision at de Spain&#8217;s galling defeat. When he
at length consented to talk with Jeffries about
coming to Sleepy Cat, the interview was of a positive
sort on the one side and an obstinate sort
on the other. De Spain raised one objection after
another to leaving Medicine Bend, and Jeffries
finally summoned a show of impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are looking for promotion, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
he demanded threateningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but not for motion without the &#8216;pro,&#8217;&#8221;
objected de Spain. &#8220;I want to stick to the railroad
business. You want to get me into the stage
business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Temporarily, yes. But I&#8217;ve told you when
you come back to the division proper, you come
as my assistant, if you make good running the
Thief River stages. Think of the salary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no immediate heirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a matter for joking, de Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that, too. How many men have
been shot on the stages in the last six months?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, now and again the stages are held up,
yes,&#8221; admitted Jeffries brusquely; &#8220;that is to be
expected where the specie shipments are large.
The Thief River mines are rotten with gold just
now. But you don&#8217;t have to drive a stage. We
supply you with good men for that, and good
guards&ndash;&ndash;men willing to take any kind of a chance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
if the pay is right. And the pay is right, and
yours as general manager will be right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never as yet generally managed any
stage line,&#8221; remarked de Spain, poking ridicule at
the title, &#8220;no matter how modest an outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will never learn younger. There is a
fascination,&#8221; declared Jeffries, ignoring the fling,
and tilting his chair eloquently back to give ease
and conviction to his words, &#8220;about running a
good stage line that no railroad business can
ever touch. There is, of course, nothing in the
Rocky Mountains, for that matter in the United
States&ndash;&ndash;nothing, I guess, in the world&ndash;&ndash;that approaches
the Thief River line in its opportunities.
Every wagon we own, from the lightest to
the heaviest, is built to order on our particular
specifications by the Studebaker people.&#8221; Here
Jeffries pointed his finger sharply at de Spain as
if to convict him of some dereliction. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
seen them! You know what they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain, bullied, haltingly nodded acquiescence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second-growth hickory in the gears,&#8221; continued
Jeffries encouragingly, &#8220;ash tongues and
boxes&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of those old buses look like ash-boxes,&#8221;
interposed de Spain irreverently.</p>
<p>But Jeffries was not to be stopped: &#8220;Timkin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
springs, ball-bearing axles&ndash;&ndash;why, man, there is
no vehicle in the world built like a Thief River
stage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are some wagon-maker, Jeff,&#8221; said de
Spain, regarding him ironically.</p>
<p>Jeffries ignored every sarcasm. &#8220;This road, as
you know, owns the line. And the net from the
specie shipments equals the net on an ordinary
railroad division. But we must have a man to
run that line that can curb the disorders along
the route. Calabasas Valley, de Spain, is a bad
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; de Spain asked as na&iuml;vely as if he had
never heard of Calabasas, though Jeffries was
nervily stating a fact bald and notorious to both.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of bad men there,&#8221; Jeffries
went on, &#8220;who are bad simply because they&#8217;ve
never had a man to show them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last &#8216;general&#8217; manager was killed there,
wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the valley, no. He was shot at Calabasas
Inn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would that make very much difference in
the way he felt about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeffries, with an effort, laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s all
right, Henry! They won&#8217;t get you.&#8221; Again he
extended his finger dogmatically: &#8220;If I thought
they would, I wouldn&#8217;t send you down there.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are young, ambitious: four thousand a
year isn&#8217;t hanging from every telegraph-pole; it
is almost twice what they are paying me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not getting shot at.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No man, Henry, knows the hour of his death.
No man in the high country knows when he is to
be made a target&ndash;&ndash;that you well understand. Men
are shot down in this country that have no more
idea of getting killed than I have&ndash;&ndash;or you have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t include me. I have a pretty good idea
of getting killed right away&ndash;&ndash;the minute I take
this job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have temporized with this Calabasas outfit
long enough,&#8221; declared Jeffries, dropping his
mask at last. &#8220;Deaf Sandusky, Logan, and that
squint-eyed thief, Dave Sassoon&ndash;&ndash;all hold-up men,
every one of them! Henry, I&#8217;m putting you in
on that job because you&#8217;ve got nerve, because you
can shoot, because I don&#8217;t think they can get
you&ndash;&ndash;and paying you a whaling big salary to
straighten things out along the Spanish Sinks.
Do you know, Henry&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Jeffries leaned forward
and lowered his tone. Master of the art of persuading
and convincing, of hammering and pounding,
of swaying the doubting and deciding the
undecided, the strong-eyed mountain-man looked
his best as he held the younger man under his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
spell. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;I suspect
that Morgan Gap bunch are really behind and
beneath a lot of this deviltry around Calabasas?
You take Gale Morgan: why, he trains with Dave
Sassoon; take his uncle, Duke: Sassoon never is
in trouble but what Duke will help him out.&#8221;
Jeffries exploded with a slight but forcible expletive.
&#8220;Was there ever a thief or a robber
driven into Morgan&#8217;s Gap that didn&#8217;t find sympathy
and shelter with some of the Morgans?
I believe they are in every game pulled on the
Thief River stages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As bad as that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeffries turned to his desk. &#8220;Ask John Lefever.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain had a long talk with John. But
John was a poor adviser. He advised no one on
any subject. He whistled, he hummed a tune,
if his hat was on he took it off, and if it happened
to be off, which was unusual, he put it on. He
extended his arm, at times, suddenly, as if on the
brink of a positive assertion. But he decided
nothing, and asserted nothing. If he talked, he
talked well and energetically; but the end of a
talk usually found him and de Spain about where
they began. So it was on this trying day&ndash;&ndash;for
Lefever was not able wholly to hide the upsetting
of his confidence of victory, and his humiliation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
at the now more distant yells from the Calabasas
and Morgan Gap victors.</p>
<p>But concerning the Morgans and their friends,
Lefever, to whom Jeffries had rudely referred the
subject at the close of his talk with de Spain,
did abandon his habitual reticence. &#8220;Rustlers,
thieves, robbers, coiners, outlaws!&#8221; he exclaimed
energetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this because they got your money to-day,
John?&#8221; asked de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind my money. I&#8217;ve got a new job
with nothing to do, and plenty of cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain asked what the job was. &#8220;On the
stages,&#8221; announced Lefever. &#8220;I am now general
superintendent of the Thief River Line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that I act for the reorganization
committee in buying alfalfa for the horses and
smokeless pipes for the guards. I am to be
your assistant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to take that job, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I know it. I am going back to Medicine
Bend to-night.&#8221; Lefever took off his hat
and twirled it skilfully on one hand, humming
softly the while. &#8220;John,&#8221; asked de Spain after
a pause, &#8220;who is that girl that shot against me
this afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; answered Lefever, thinking, shocked,
of Jeffries&#8217;s words, &#8220;was Nan Morgan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just one of the Morgans; lives in the Gap
with old Duke Morgan, her uncle; lived there as
long as I can remember. Some shot, Henry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can she live in the Gap,&#8221; mused de Spain,
&#8220;with an outfit like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got nowhere else to live, I guess. I believe
you&#8217;d better change your mind, Henry, and stay
with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned de Spain meditatively, &#8220;I&#8217;m
not going to stay. I&#8217;ve had glory enough out of
this town for a while.&#8221; He picked up his hat and
put it on. Lefever thought it well to make no
response. He was charged with the maintenance
and operation of the stage-line arsenal at Sleepy
Cat, and spent many of his idle moments toying
with the firearms. He busied himself now with
the mechanism of a huge revolver&ndash;&ndash;one that the
stage-driver, Frank Elpaso, had wrecked on the
head of a troublesome negro coming in from the
mines. De Spain in turn took off his hat, poked
the crown discontentedly, and, rising with a loss
of amiability in his features and manner, walked
out of the room.</p>
<p>The late sun was streaming down the full length
of Main Street. The street was still filled with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
loiterers who had spent the day at the fair, and
lingered now in town in the vague hope of seeing
a brawl or a fight before sundown&ndash;&ndash;cattlemen and
cowboys from the northern ranges, sheepmen from
the Spider River country, small ranchers and
irrigators from the Bear basin, who picked their
steps carefully, and spoke with prudence in the
presence of roisterers from the Spanish Sinks,
and gunmen and gamblers from Calabasas and
Morgan&#8217;s Gap. The Morgans themselves and
their following were out to the last retainer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE THIEF RIVER STAGE LINE</h3>
</div>
<p>Sleepy Cat has little to distinguish it in its
casual appearance from the ordinary mountain
railroad town of the western Rockies. The
long, handsome railroad station, the eating-house,
and the various division-headquarters buildings
characteristic of such towns are in Sleepy Cat
built of local granite. The yard facilities, shops,
and roundhouses are the last word in modern railroad
construction, and the division has not infrequently
held the medal for safety records.</p>
<p>But more than these things go toward making
up the real Sleepy Cat. It is a community with
earlier-than-railroad traditions. Sleepy Cat has
been more or less of a settlement almost since the
day of Jim Bridger, and its isolated position in
the midst of a country of vast deserts, far mountain
ranges, and widely separated watercourses
has made it from the earliest Western days a
rendezvous for hunters, trappers, emigrants, prospectors,
and adventurers&ndash;&ndash;and these have all, in
some measure, left their impress on the town.</p>
<p>Sleepy Cat lies prettily on a high plateau north
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
and east of the railroad, which makes a d&eacute;tour
here to the north to round the Superstition Range;
it is a county-seat, and this, where counties are
as large as ordinary Eastern States, gives it some
political distinction.</p>
<p>The principal street lies just north of the railroad,
and parallels it. A modern and substantial
hotel has for some years filled the corner above
the station. The hotel was built by Harry Tenison
soon after the opening of the Thief River
gold-fields. Along Main Street to the west are
strung the usual mountain-town stores and saloons,
but to the north a pretty residence district has
been built up about the court-house square.
And a good water-supply, pumped from Rat
River, a brawling mountain stream that flows
just south of the town, has encouraged the care
of lawns and trees.</p>
<p>Before de Spain had walked far he heard music
from the open-air dancing-pavilion in Grant
Street. Stirred by an idle curiosity, he turned the
corner and stopped to watch the crowded couples
whirling up and down the raised platform under
paper lanterns and red streamers to the music
of an automatic piano. He took his place in a
fringe of onlookers that filled the sidewalk. But
he was thinking as he stood, not of the boisterous
dancing or the clumsy dancers, but of the broken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
lever and the defeat at the fair-grounds. It still
rankled in his mind. While he stood thinking
the music ceased.</p>
<p>A man, who appeared to be in authority,
walked to the centre of the dancing-floor and
made an announcement that de Spain failed to
catch. The manager apparently repeated it to
those of his patrons that crowded around him,
and more than once to individual inquirers who
had not caught the purport of what had been
said. These late comers he pushed back, and when
the floor had been well cleared he nodded to the
boy operating the piano, and looked toward a
young couple standing in an attitude of waiting
at the head of the hall.</p>
<p>All eyes being turned their way, de Spain&#8217;s attention
as well was drawn toward them. The
man was powerful in stature, and rather too heavy,
but straight as an Indian. His small, reddish
face was tanned by the sun and wind, and his
manner as he stood with arms akimbo, his hands
resting on his belt, facing his partner and talking
to her, had the confidence of a man at ease with
women. From the handsome hat which, as he
turned to his partner for the dance, he sent spinning
toward a table beside the piano, the soft
brown shirt and flowing tie, down to the small,
high-heeled and spurred boots, he wore the distinctive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
cowboy rig of the mountains, even to
the heavy hip-holster, in which his revolver was
slung. He was, in fact, rather too smartly dressed,
too confident in manner to please de Spain, who
was in no mood to be pleased anyway, and who
could conceive a dislike for a man the instant he
set eyes on him&ndash;&ndash;and a liking as quickly. He
seemed to recall, too, that this particular fellow
had crowed the loudest when he himself forfeited
the shooting-match earlier in the day.</p>
<p>But de Spain, unamiable as he now was, looked
with unconcealed interest at the man&#8217;s dancing
partner. She, too, was browned by the mountain
sun and air&ndash;&ndash;a slight, erect girl, her head
well set, and a delicate waist-line above a belted
brown skirt, which just reached the tops of her
small, high, tan riding-boots. She wore a soft,
French-gray Stetson hat. Her dark-brown hair
was deftly hidden under it, but troublesome ringlets
strayed about her ears as if she had not seen
a glass for hours, and these, standing first with
one hand and then the other laid against her
leather belt, she put up into place, and as if not
wholly at ease with her surroundings. Instead
of looking at her partner, who talked to her while
waiting, her eyes, noticeably pretty, wandered
about the platform, resting at moments on the
closely drawn lines of spectators. They reflected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
in their unrest the dissatisfied expression of her
face. A talkative woman standing just in front
of de Spain, told a companion that the man was
Gale Morgan, a nephew of Satterlee, laziest of the
Morgans. De Spain, who never had to look
twice at any woman, at once recognized in the
dancing partner the little Music Mountain girl
who had been his undoing at the target; the
woman added that Nan was, in some hazy degree,
Gale&#8217;s cousin.</p>
<p>The energetic piano thumped the strains of a
two-step. Gale Morgan extended his arm toward
Nan; she looked very slight at his side. But
instead of taking her position, she drew back,
looking up and frowning as she seemed to speak
objectingly to Gale. De Spain saw her hesitation
without catching its import. The talkative
woman near at hand was more divining. &#8220;Lord,
that Nan Morgan makes me tired,&#8221; she exclaimed
to her gum-chewing companion, &#8220;ever
see anything like her? First she wouldn&#8217;t dance
unless the floor was cleared&ndash;&ndash;Sleepy Cat folks
ain&#8217;t good enough for them Music Mountain
cattle thieves! And now the music doesn&#8217;t suit
her. Listen to that boob of a boy trying one
piece after another to get one to suit my outlaw
lady. Nerve!&#8221;</p>
<p>But while the impatient woman chafed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
right tune was found, and Nan Morgan&#8217;s face, as
she watched the manipulator of the piano, brightened.
&#8220;Faster!&#8221; she cried under her breath,
taking her position on her cousin&#8217;s arm. Then,
responding with a sort of fiery impatience to her
partner&#8217;s guiding, she caught the rapid step of
the music, and together the two swept down the
floor.</p>
<p>Whatever the impatience of the crowd over the
finicky start, the spectators soon showed their admiration
of the dancing with unrestrained hand-clapping,
and followed with approving outcries.
De Spain, standing apart, watched Nan&#8217;s flying
feet, wondering how she and her people could
possibly be what they were painted, and whether
they really were so or not. Every swaying step,
every agile turn proved how sure she was of herself,
and how perfectly her body answered to
every exaction of the quick movement of the
dance. Gale Morgan seemed the merest attendant
for his partner, who, with quickened pulses,
gave herself up more and more to the lively call
of the music.</p>
<p>Once the two swung away out, near to de
Spain&#8217;s corner. As Nan whirled by, de Spain,
either with the infection of the music or from
her nearness to him, caught his breath. His eyes
riveted themselves on her flushed face as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
passed&ndash;&ndash;oblivious of his presence&ndash;&ndash;and he recalled
how in the morning she had handled her
rifle in the same quick, sure way. De Spain
could not dance at all; but no one could successfully
accuse him of not knowing how to handle
any sort of a gun. It was only now, as she came
so very close to him for the first time since the
mortification of the morning, and he saw the
smoothness of her pink-brown cheeks, that he
could ungrudgingly give her full credit for shooting
him down. He forgave her, unasked, the
humiliation she had put on him. He felt an impulse
to go up to her&ndash;&ndash;now that she had stopped
dancing&ndash;&ndash;and congratulate her honestly, instead
of boorishly as he had done at the match, and to
say, unreservedly, that she was the better shot&ndash;&ndash;indeed,
one of the best he had ever seen.</p>
<p>But while he thought all of this he did not stir
a step. The two dancers at once disappeared,
and a new and rougher party crowded out on the
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, isn&#8217;t that a pretty bunch!&#8221; exclaimed
the critical woman again. &#8220;That&#8217;s the Calabasas
gang. Look at those four men with the red neckerchiefs.
Sandusky, that big fellow, with the
crooked jaw&ndash;&ndash;Butch, they call him&ndash;&ndash;and his
jaw&#8217;s not half as crooked as Sandusky himself,
either. He couldn&#8217;t lie in bed straight. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Harvey Logan, with his black hair plastered over
his eyes. Why, for one drink those two fellows
would turn loose on this crowd and kill half a
dozen. And there&#8217;s two of Duke Morgan&#8217;s cowboys
with them, boozing old Bull Page, and that
squint-eyed Sassoon&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s worse than the others,
that fellow&ndash;&ndash;a fine bunch to allow in this town.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain had excellent ears. He had heard of
these Calabasas men&ndash;&ndash;of Sandusky and of the
little fellow, Logan. They had much more than
a local reputation as outlaws; they were known
from one end of the Superstition Range to the
other as evil-doers of more than ordinary ruthlessness.
De Spain, from force of habit, studied
every detail of their make-up. Both showed
more than traces of drink, and both securing
partners joined rudely in the dancing. It had
become second nature to de Spain to note even
insignificant details concerning men, and he took
an interest in and remarked how very low Logan
carried his gun in front of his hip. Sandusky&#8217;s
holster was slung higher and farther back on the
side. Logan wore a tan shirt and khaki. Sandusky,
coatless, was dressed in a white shirt,
with a red tie, and wore a soiled, figured waistcoat
fastened at the bottom by a cut-glass button.</p>
<p>The Sleepy Cat gossip commented on how much
money these men had been spending all day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
She wondered aloud, reckless apparently of consequences,
who had been robbed, lately, to provide
it. Her companion scolded her for stirring
up talk that might make trouble; averred she
didn&#8217;t believe half the stories she heard; asserted
that these men lived quietly at Calabasas, minding
their own affairs. &#8220;And they&#8217;re kind to poor
folks, too.&#8221; &#8220;Sure,&#8221; grimaced the obdurate one,
&#8220;with other people&#8217;s money.&#8221; De Spain had no
difficulty in placing the two women. One was
undoubtedly the wife of a railroad man, who hated
the mountain outlaws, and the other was, with
equal certainty, a town sympathizer with slandered
men, and the two represented the two community
elements in Sleepy Cat.</p>
<p>De Spain, discontented, turning again into
Main Street, continued on toward the Thief
River stage barn. He knew an old Scotch Medicine
Bend barnman that worked there, a boyhood
friend; but the man, McAlpin, was out.
After looking the horses over and inspecting the
wagons with a new but mild curiosity, awakened
by Jeffries&#8217;s proposal, de Spain walked back toward
the station. He had virtually decided not to
take the job that Jeffries painted as so attractive,
and resolved now to take the night train back to
Medicine Bend. Medicine Bend was his home.
He knew every man, woman, and child in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
town. Before the tragic death of his father, his
mother had lived there, and de Spain had grown
up in the town and gone to school there. He was
a railroad man, anyway&ndash;&ndash;a modest trainmaster&ndash;&ndash;and
not eager for stage-line management.</p>
<p>The prospect of reducing the Sinks to a law-and-order
basis at his own proper risk could not
be alluring to the most aggressive of law-and-order
men&ndash;&ndash;and de Spain was not aggressive. Yet
within a moment of his sensible decision he was
to be hurried by a mere accident to an exactly
contrary fate.</p>
<p>As he passed Grant Street again he encountered
a party on horseback heading for the river
bridge. Trotting their horses leisurely, they
turned the corner directly in front of de Spain.
There were five in the company. Three of the
men were riding abreast and a little ahead. Of
these, the middle horseman was a spare man of
forty years, with a black military hat, and a
frankly disreputable air. His face was drawn up
into a one-sided smile, marked by a deep, vertical
wrinkle running up, close to his nose, from the
corner of his mouth almost to the inner corner of
his eye. Satt Morgan&#8217;s smile was habitual and
lessened his stern aspect. At his right rode his
cousin, Duke Morgan, older, shorter, and stouter.
His square, heavy-jawed, smooth-shaven face was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
lighted by hard, keen eyes, and finished by an uncompromising
chin. Duke was the real head of
the clan, of which there were numerous branches
in the Superstition Mountains, all looking with
friendliness or enmity to the Morgans of Morgan&#8217;s
Gap.</p>
<p>The yellow-haired man riding on the left, with
a red face and red-lidded, squinting eyes, was in
stature something between the two Morgans, and
about the age of the elder cousin. His shoulders
slouched, and he showed none of the blood of
his companions. But this man, David Sassoon,
the Calabasas gambler, quondam cowboy, and
chronic brawler, stood in some way close to the
different Morgans, and was reputed to have got
each of them, at different times, out of more than
one troublesome affair, either by sheer force of
arms, or through his resourceful cunning.</p>
<p>These men were followed by a younger man
riding with a very young woman. De Spain knew
none of the front-rank men, but he knew well
Nan Morgan and her dancing partner.</p>
<p>They were talking together, and Nan seemed
from her manner at odds with her companion.
He appeared to be trying to laugh the situation
off when he caught sight of de Spain pausing for
them to pass. Gale&#8217;s face lighted as he set eyes
on him, and he spoke quickly to Nan. De Spain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
could not at first hear his words, but he needed no
ears to interpret his laugh and the expression on
his face. Nan, persistently importuned, looked
around. She saw de Spain, much closer, it would
seem, than she had expected to see a man looking
directly at her, and her eyes rested on him only
a moment. The substance of her cousin&#8217;s words
she apparently had not caught, and he repeated
them in a louder voice: &#8220;There&#8217;s your handsome
Medicine Bend gunman!&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan, glancing again toward de Spain, seemed
aware that he heard. She looked away. De
Spain tightened up with a rage. The blood
rushed to his face, the sarcasm struck in. If the
birthmark could have deepened with humiliation
it would have done so at the instant of the cold
inspection of the girl&#8217;s pretty eyes. But he cared
less for Nan&#8217;s inspection, cold as it was, than for
the jibe of her satisfied cousin. Not content,
Gale, calling ahead to the others, invited their attention
to the man on the street corner. De
Spain felt minded to hurl an insult at them in a
body. It would have been four to one&ndash;&ndash;rather
awkward odds even if they were mounted&ndash;&ndash;and
there was a woman. But he only stood still, returning
their inspection as insolently as silence
could. Each face was faithfully photographed
and filed in his memory, and his steady gaze followed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
them until they rode down the hill and
clattered jauntily out on the swaying suspension
bridge that still crosses the Rat River at Grant
Street, and connects the whole south country&ndash;&ndash;the
Spanish Sinks, the Thief River gold-fields, the
saw-toothed Superstition Range, Morgan&#8217;s Gap,
and Music Mountain with Sleepy Cat and the
railroad.</p>
<p>De Spain, walking down Grant Street, watched
the party disappear among the hills across the
river. The encounter had stirred him. He already
hated the Morgans, at least all except the
blue-eyed girl, and she, it was not difficult to
divine from her expression, was, at least, disdainful
of her morning rival.</p>
<p>Reaching the station platform while still busy
with his thoughts, de Spain encountered Jeffries
and Lefever.</p>
<p>&#8220;When are you coming up to take my job,
Henry?&#8221; demanded the superintendent without
any parley.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not coming up,&#8221; announced de Spain
bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not coming up, eh? All right, we&#8217;ll find
somebody that will come up,&#8221; retorted Jeffries.
&#8220;John,&#8221; he added, &#8220;wire Medicine Bend to send
Farrell Kennedy here in the morning to see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the reason that fellow sticks so close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
to Medicine Bend?&#8221; demanded Jeffries, when
Lefever joined him later in his office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me,&#8221; frowned Lefever perplexed.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me. Henry is odd in some ways.
You can&#8217;t tell what&#8217;s going on inside that fellow&#8217;s
head by looking at the outside of it.&#8221; Jeffries
grunted coldly at this bit of wisdom. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
you what I should think&ndash;&ndash;if I had to think:
Henry de Spain has never found out rightly who
was responsible for the death of his father. He
expects to do it, sometime; and he thinks sometime
he&#8217;s going to find out right there in Medicine
Bend.&#8221;</p>
<p>While they were talking the train was pulling
out for Medicine Bend with de Spain on board.</p>
<p>It was a tedious ride, and de Spain was much
too engaged with his thoughts to sleep. The
Morgans were in his head, and he could not be
rid of them. He recalled having been told that
long ago some of these same Morgans lived on
the Peace River above his father&#8217;s ranch. Every
story he had ever heard of their wild lives, for
they were men sudden in quarrel and reckless of
sequel, came back to his mind. He wondered
what sort of a young girl this could be who lived
among them&ndash;&ndash;who <i>could</i> live among them&ndash;&ndash;and
be what she seemed at a glance to be&ndash;&ndash;a fawn
among mountain-wolves.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>It was late when he reached Medicine Bend,
and raining&ndash;&ndash;a dismal kind of a night. Instead
of going to his room, just across the street from
the station, he went up-stairs and sat down with
the train-despatchers. After an hour of indecision,
marked by alternative fits of making up
and unmaking his mind, he went, instead of going
to bed, into the telegraph-room, where black-haired
Dick Grady sat at a key.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the fight to-night at Sleepy Cat?&#8221;
Grady asked at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;What fight?&#8221; demanded de Spain perfunctorily.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Calabasas gang got to going again up
there to-night. They say one of the Morgans
was in it. Some town, that Sleepy Cat, eh,
Henry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What Morgan was in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gale Morgan. A lot of stuff came in on it
an hour ago. Was there anything started when
you left?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear of anything,&#8221; responded de
Spain. But his indifference to the subject was
marked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; demanded the operator.
&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you well to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfectly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleepy?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>De Spain roused himself. &#8220;Dick, have you got
a Sleepy Cat wire open?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Jeffries I&#8217;ll take that Thief River stage
job.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE SPANISH SINKS</h3>
</div>
<p>From a car window at Sleepy Cat may be
seen, stretching far down into the southwest
a chain of towering peaks, usually snow-clad, that
dominate the desert in every direction for almost
a hundred miles. In two extended groups, separated
by a narrow but well-defined break, they
constitute a magnificent rampart, named by
Spaniards the Superstition Mountains, and they
stretch beyond the horizon to the south, along
the vast depression known locally as the Spanish
Sinks. The break on the eastern side of the chain
comes about twenty miles southwest of Sleepy
Cat, and is marked on the north by the most
striking, and in some respects most majestic peak
in the range&ndash;&ndash;Music Mountain; the break itself
has taken the name of its earliest white settlers,
and is called Morgan&#8217;s Gap. No railroad has
ever yet penetrated this southern country, despite
the fact that rich mines have been opened
along these mountains, and are still being opened;
but it lies to-day in much of the condition of primitive
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
savagery, and lawlessness, as the word is conventionally
accepted, that obtained when the
first rush was made for the Thief River gold-fields.</p>
<p>It is not to be understood that law is an unknown
equation between Calabasas and Thief
River, or even between Calabasas and Sleepy Cat.
But as statute law it suffers so many infractions
as to be hardly recognizable in the ordinary sense.
Business is done in this country; but business
must halt everywhere with its means of communication,
and in the Music Mountain country it
still rests on the facilities of a stage line. The
stage line is a big and vigorous affair, a perfectly
organized railroad adjunct with the best horses,
the best wagons, the best freighting outfits that
money can supply.</p>
<p>But this is by no means, in its civilizing effect,
a railroad. A railroad drives lawlessness before
it&ndash;&ndash;the Music Mountain country still leans on
stage-line law. The bullion wagons still travel
the difficult roads. They look for safety to their
armed horsemen; the four and six horse stages
look to the armed guard, the wayfarer must look
to his horse&ndash;&ndash;and it should be a good one; the
mountain rancher to his rifle, the cattle thief to
the moonless night, the bandit to his wits, the
gunman to his holster: these include practically
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
all of the people that travel the Spanish Sinks,
except the Morgans and the Mormons. The
Mormons looked to the Morgans for safety; the
Morgans to themselves.</p>
<p>For many a year the Morgans have been almost
overlords of the Music Mountain country.
They own, or have laid claim to, an extended territory
in the mountains, a Spanish grant. One of
the first mountain Morgans married a Spanish
girl, and during the early days, when the Morgans
were not fighting some one out of court, they were
fighting some one in court on their endless and
involved titles.</p>
<p>But whether they won domain in lawsuit or
lost it, one pearl of their holdings they never submitted
to the jurisdiction of any tribunal other
than their own arms. Morgan&#8217;s Gap opens south
of Music Mountain, less than ten miles west of
Calabasas. It is a narrow valley where valleys
are more precious than water&ndash;&ndash;for the mountain
valley means water&ndash;&ndash;and this in a country where
water is much more precious than life. And some
of the best of this land at the foot of Music Mountain
was the maternal inheritance of Nan Morgan.</p>
<p>At Calabasas the Thief River stage line maintains
completely equipped relay barns. They are
over twenty miles from Sleepy Cat, but nearly
fifty the other way from Thief River. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
unequal division is not due to what was desirable
when the route was laid out, but to the limit of
what man could do in the never-conquered desert.
This supplies at Calabasas a spring, to tempt the
unwary traveller still farther within its clutches.
A large number of horses are kept at Calabasas,
and the barn crews are quartered there in a company
barrack. Along the low ridges and in the
shallow depressions about Calabasas Spring there
are a very few widely separated shacks, once built
by freighters and occupied by squatter outlaws
to be within reach of water. This gives the vicinity
something of the appearance of a poorly
sustained prairie-dog town. And except these
shacks, there is nothing between Calabasas, Thief
River, and the mountains except sunshine and
alkali. I say nothing, meaning especially nothing,
in the way of a human habitation.</p>
<p>But there is a queer inn at Calabasas. A pioneer
Thief River prospector, mad with thirst,
fought his way across the Sinks to the Calabasas
Spring, and wandered thence one day into Sleepy
Cat. In a delirium of gratitude he ordered built
at Calabasas what he termed a hotel, to provide
at that forbidden oasis for the luxurious comfort
of future thirst-mad wanderers. It was built of
lumber hauled a thousand miles, and equipped
with luxuries brought three thousand&ndash;&ndash;a fearsome,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
rambling structure, big enough for all the prospectors
in the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>Having built this monument, creditable to his
good-will rather than his good sense, the unfortunate
man went really mad, and had the sorry
distinction of being the first person to be put in
the insane asylum at Bear Dance. It had never
occurred to him that any one had any title to,
or that any madder man would lay any claim to,
so accursed a spot as Calabasas. But old Duke
Morgan announced in due time that the hotel
was built on Morgan land, and belonged to the
Morgans. Nobody outside a madhouse could be
found to dispute with Duke Morgan a title to
land within ten miles of Morgan&#8217;s Gap, and none
but a lunatic would attempt to run a hotel at
Calabasas, anyway. However, a solution of the
difficulty was found: Duke&#8217;s colorable title gave
the cue to his retainers in the Gap, and in time
they carted away piecemeal most of the main
building, leaving for years the kitchen and the
servants&#8217; quarters adjoining it to owls, lizards,
scorpions, and spiders.</p>
<p>Meantime, to tap the fast-developing gold-fields,
the freight route and stages had been put
in, and the barns built at Calabasas. A need naturally
developed for at least one feature of a
hotel&ndash;&ndash;a barroom. A newer lunatic answered the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
call of civilization&ndash;&ndash;a man only mildly insane
stocked the kitchen range with liquors, and fitted
up in a crude way the ice-boxes&ndash;&ndash;where there never
was ice&ndash;&ndash;serving pantries, and other odd nooks for
sleeping quarters. Here the thirsty stage passenger,
little suspecting the origin of the facilities
offered him for a drink, may choose strong drink
instead of water&ndash;&ndash;or rather, he is restricted to
strong drink where water might once have been
had&ndash;&ndash;the spring being piped now half a mile to
the barns for the horses. And this shack, as it is
locally called, run by a Mexican, is still the inn
at Calabasas. And it continues to contribute,
through its stirring annals, to the tragic history
of the continental divide.</p>
<p>It need hardly be said that Duke Morgan laid
claim also to the Calabasas Spring. But on this
the company, being a corporation, fought him.
And after somewhat less of argument and somewhat
more of siege and shooting, a compromise
was reached whereby the company bought annually
at an exorbitant price all of Duke, Satterlee,
and Vance Morgan&#8217;s hay, and as the Morgans
had small rivers of water in the mountains, and
never, except when crowded, drank water, a
<i>modus vivendi</i> was arranged between the claimants.
The only sufferer through this was the Mexican
publican, who found every Morgan his landlord,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
and demanding from him tithes over the bar.
But force is usually met with cunning, and such
Morgans as would not pay in advance at Calabasas,
when thirsty, often found the half-mad
publican out of goods.</p>
<p>The Calabasas Inn stood in one of the loneliest
canyons of the whole seventy miles between
Sleepy Cat and Thief River; it looked in its depletion
to be what it was, a sombre, mysterious,
sun, wind, and alkali beaten pile, around which
no one by any chance ever saw a sign of life. It
was a ruin like those pretentious deserted structures
sometimes seen in frontier towns&ndash;&ndash;relics of
the wide-open days, which stand afterward, stark
and sombre, to serve as bats&#8217; nests or blind-pigs.
The inn at Calabasas looked its part&ndash;&ndash;a haunt of
rustlers, a haven of nameless men, a refuge of
road-agents.</p>
<p>The very first time de Spain made an inspection
trip over the stage line with Lefever, he was
conscious of the sinister air of this lonely building.
He and Lefever had ridden down from the
barn, while their horses were being changed, to
look at the place. De Spain wanted to look over
everything connected in any way, however remotely,
with the operation of his wagons, and this
joint, Lefever had told him, was where the freighters
and drivers were not infrequently robbed of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
their money. It was here that one of their own
men, Bill McCarty, once &#8220;scratched a man&#8217;s
neck&#8221; with a knife&ndash;&ndash;which, Bill explained, he just
&#8220;happened&#8221; to have in his hand&ndash;&ndash;for cheating at
cards. Lefever pointed out the unlucky gambler&#8217;s
grave as he and de Spain rode into the canyon
toward the inn.</p>
<p>Not a sign of any sort was displayed about the
habitation. No man was invited to enter, no
man warned to keep out, none was anywhere in
sight. The stage men dismounted, threw their
lines, pushed open the front door of the house and
entered a room of perhaps sixteen by twenty feet.
It had been the original barroom. A long, high,
elaborately carved mahogany bar, as much out of
keeping as it possibly could be with its surroundings,
stretched across the farther side of the room.
The left end, as they faced the bar, was brought
around to escape a small window opening on a
court or patio to the rear of the room. Back of
the bar itself, about midway, a low door in the
bare wall gave entrance to a rear room. Aside
from this big, queer-looking piece of mahogany,
the low window at the left end of it, and the low
door at the back, the room presented nothing but
walls. Two windows flanking the front door
helped to light it, but not a mirror, picture, chair,
table, bottle, or glass was to be seen. De Spain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
covered every feature of the interior at a glance.
&#8220;Quiet around here, John,&#8221; he remarked casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the quietest place in the Rocky Mountains
most of the time. But when it is noisy, believe
me, it is noisy. Look at the bullet-holes in
the walls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old story,&#8221; remarked de Spain, inspecting
with mild-mannered interest the punctured plastering,
&#8220;they always shoot high.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked over to the left end of the bar, noting
the hard usage shown by the ornate mahogany,
and spreading his hands wide open, palms down,
on the face of it, glanced at the low window on
his left, opening on the gravelled patio. He
peered, in the semidarkness, at the battered door
behind the bar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry,&#8221; observed Lefever, &#8220;if you are looking
for a drink, it would only be fair, as well as
politic, to call the Mexican.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, John, I&#8217;m not looking for one.
And I know you don&#8217;t drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to know, then, where the Mexican
keeps his gun?&#8221; hazarded Lefever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not especially. I just want to know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s behind the bar. That&#8217;s natural, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Very complete fittings and compartments told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
of the labor spent in preparing this inner side for
the convenience of the bartender and the requirements
of exacting patrons, but nothing in the way
of equipment, not so much as a pewter spoon,
lay anywhere visible.</p>
<p>De Spain, turning, looked all around the room
again. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think,&#8221; he said slowly,
&#8220;from looking at the place there was a road-agent
within a thousand miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t think, from riding through the
Superstition Mountains there was a lion within a
thousand miles. I&#8217;ve hunted them for eleven
years, and I never saw one except when the dogs
drove &#8217;em out; but for eleven years they saw me.
If we haven&#8217;t been seen coming in here by some
of this Calabasas bunch, I miss my guess,&#8221; declared
Lefever cheerfully.</p>
<p>The batten door behind the bar now began to
open slowly and noiselessly. Lefever peered
through it. &#8220;Come in, Pedro,&#8221; he cried reassuringly,
&#8220;come in, man. This is no officer, no
revenue agent looking for your license. Meet a
friend, Pedro,&#8221; he continued encouragingly, as
the swarthy publican, low-browed and sullen,
emerged very deliberately from the inner darkness
into the obscurity of the barroom, and bent
his one good eye searchingly on de Spain. &#8220;This,&#8221;
Lefever&#8217;s left hand lay familiarly on the back of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
de Spain&#8217;s shoulder, &#8220;is our new manager, Mr.
Henry de Spain. Henry, shake hands with
Mexico.&#8221;</p>
<p>This invitation to shake hands seemed an
empty formality. De Spain never shook hands
with anybody; at least if he did so, he extended,
through habit long inured, his left hand, with an
excuse for the soreness of his right. Pedro did
not even bat his remaining eye at the invitation.
The situation, as Lefever facetiously remarked,
remained about where it was before he spoke, and
nothing daunted, he asked de Spain what he would
drink. De Spain sidestepped again by asking
for a cigar. Lefever, professing he would not
drink alone, called for cigarettes. While Pedro
produced them, from nowhere apparently, as a
conjurer picks cards out of the air, the sound of
galloping horses came through the open door. A
moment later three men walked, single file, into
the room. De Spain stood at the left end of the
bar, and Lefever introduced him to Gale Morgan,
to David Sassoon, and to Sassoon&#8217;s crony, Deaf
Sandusky, as the new stage-line manager. The
later arrivals lined up before the bar, Sandusky
next to Lefever and de Spain, so he could hear
what was said. Pedro from his den produced
two queer-looking bottles and a supply of glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;De Spain,&#8221; Gale Morgan began bluntly, &#8220;one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
of our men was put off a stage of yours last week
by Frank Elpaso.&#8221; He spoke without any preliminary
compliments, and his heavy voice was
bellicose.</p>
<p>De Spain, regarding him undisturbed, answered
after a little pause: &#8220;Elpaso told me he put a
man off his stage last week for fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; contradicted Morgan loudly, &#8220;not for
fighting. Elpaso was drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the name of the man Elpaso put off,
John?&#8221; asked de Spain, looking at Lefever.</p>
<p>Morgan hooked his thumb toward the man
standing at his side. &#8220;Here&#8217;s the man right here,
Dave Sassoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sassoon never looked a man in the face when
the man looked at him, except by implication;
it was almost impossible, without surprising him,
to catch his eyes with your eyes. He seemed now
to regard de Spain keenly, as the latter, still attending
to Morgan&#8217;s statement, replied: &#8220;Elpaso
tells a pretty straight story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elpaso couldn&#8217;t tell a straight story if he
tried,&#8221; interjected Sassoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the statement of three other passengers;
they confirm Elpaso. According to them,
Sassoon&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; de Spain looked straight at the accused,
&#8220;was drunk and abusive, and kept trying
to put some of the other passengers off. Finally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
he put his feet in the lap of Pumperwasser, our
tank and windmill man, and Pumperwasser hit
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan, stepping back from the bar, waved his
hand with an air of finality toward his inoffensive
companion: &#8220;Here is Sassoon, right here&ndash;&ndash;he can
tell the whole story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those fellows were miners,&#8221; muttered Sassoon.
His utterance was broken, but he spoke
fast. &#8220;They&#8217;ll side with the guards every time
against a cattleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one fair thing to do, de Spain,&#8221;
declared Morgan. He looked severely at de Spain:
&#8220;Discharge Elpaso.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain, his hands resting on the bar, drew
one foot slowly back. &#8220;Not on the showing I
have now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One of the passengers who
joined in the statement is Jeffries, the railroad
superintendent at Sleepy Cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Expect a railroad superintendent to tell the
truth about a Calabasas man?&#8221; demanded Sassoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should expect him at least to be sober,&#8221; retorted
de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sassoon,&#8221; interposed Morgan belligerently,
&#8220;is a man whose word can always be depended
on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To convey his meaning,&#8221; intervened Lefever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
cryptically. &#8220;Of course, I know,&#8221; he asserted,
earnest to the point of vehemence. &#8220;Every one
in Calabasas has the highest respect for Sassoon.
That is understood. And,&#8221; he added with as
much impressiveness as if he were talking sense,
&#8220;everybody in Calabasas would be sorry to see
Sassoon put off a stage. But Sassoon is off: that
is the situation. We are sorry. If it occurs
again&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; thundered Morgan, resenting
the interference. &#8220;De Spain is the manager,
isn&#8217;t he? What we want to know is, what
you are going to do about it?&#8221; he demanded, addressing
de Spain again.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing more to be done,&#8221; returned
de Spain composedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve already told Elpaso
if Sassoon starts another fight on a stage to put
him off again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan&#8217;s fist came down on the bar. &#8220;Look
here, de Spain! You come from Medicine Bend,
don&#8217;t you? Well, you can&#8217;t bully Music Mountain
men&ndash;&ndash;understand that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any time you have a real grievance, Morgan,
I&#8217;ll be glad to consider it,&#8221; said de Spain. &#8220;When
one of your men is drunk and quarrelsome he will
be put off like any other disturber. That we can&#8217;t
avoid. Public stages can&#8217;t be run any other
way.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; retorted Morgan. &#8220;If you take
that tack for your new management, we&#8217;ll see how
you get along running stages down in this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will run them peaceably, just as long as
we can,&#8221; smiled de Spain. &#8220;We will get on with
everybody that gives us a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan pointed a finger at him. &#8220;I give you
a chance, de Spain, right now. Will you discharge
Elpaso?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan almost caught his breath at the refusal.
But de Spain could be extremely blunt, and in
the parting shots between the two he gave no
ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeffries put me here to stop this kind of rowdyism
on the stages,&#8221; he said to Lefever on their
way back to the barn. &#8220;This is a good time to
begin. And Sassoon and Gale Morgan are good
men to begin with,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>As the horses of the two men emerged from
the canyon they saw a slender horsewoman riding
in toward the barn from the Music Mountain
trail. She stopped in front of McAlpin, the barn
boss, who stood outside the office door. McAlpin,
the old Medicine Bend barnman, had been
promoted from Sleepy Cat by the new manager.
De Spain recognized the roan pony, but, aside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
from that, a glance at the figure of the rider, as
she sat with her back to him, was enough to assure
him of Nan Morgan. He spurred ahead fast
enough to overhear a request she was making of
McAlpin to mail a letter for her. She also asked
McAlpin, just as de Spain drew up, whether the
down stage had passed. McAlpin told her it
had. De Spain, touching his hat, spoke: &#8220;I am
going right up to Sleepy Cat. I&#8217;ll mail your letter
if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him in some surprise, and then
glanced toward Lefever, who now rode up. De
Spain was holding out his hand for the letter.
His eyes met Nan&#8217;s, and each felt the moment
was a sort of challenge. De Spain, a little self-conscious
under her inspection, was aware only
of her rather fearless eyes and the dark hair under
her fawn cowboy hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she responded evenly. &#8220;If the
stage is gone I will hold it to add something.&#8221;
So saying, she tucked the letter inside her blouse
and spoke to her pony, which turned leisurely
down the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to get acquainted with your country
to-day,&#8221; returned de Spain, managing with
his knee to keep his own horse moving alongside
Nan as she edged away.</p>
<p>She seemed disinclined to answer, but the silence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
and the awkwardness of his presence drew at
length a dry disclaimer: &#8220;This is not my country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood,&#8221; exclaimed de Spain, following
his doubtful advantage, &#8220;you lived out this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I live near Music Mountain,&#8221; returned Nan
somewhat ungraciously, using her own skill at the
same time to walk her horse away from her unwelcome
companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of Music Mountain,&#8221; continued de
Spain, urging his lagging steed. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often
wanted to get over there to hunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan, without speaking, ruthlessly widened the
distance between the two. De Spain unobtrusively
spurred his steed to greater activity. &#8220;You
must have a great deal of game around you. Do
you hunt?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>He knew she was famed as a huntress, but he
could make no headway whatever against her
studied reserve. He watched her hands, graceful
even in heavy gloves; he noticed the neck-piece
of her tan blouse, and liked the brown throat
and the chin set so resolutely against him. He
surmised that she perhaps felt some contempt for
him because she had outshot him, and he continued
to ask about game, hoping for a chance in
some far-off time to redeem his marksmanship
before her and giving her every possible chance to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
invite him to try the hunting around Music
Mountain.</p>
<p>She was deaf to the broadest hints; and when
at length she excused herself and turned her pony
from the Sleepy Cat road into the Morgan Gap
trail, de Spain had been defeated in every attempt
to arouse the slightest interest in anything he had
said. But, watching with regret, at the parting,
the trim lines of her figure as she dashed away on
the desert trail, seated as if a part of her spirited
horse, he felt only a fast-rising resolution to attempt
again to break through her stubborn reticence
and know her better.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>FIRST BLOOD AT CALABASAS</h3>
</div>
<p>Nothing more than de Spain&#8217;s announcement
that he would sustain his stage-guards
was necessary to arouse a violent resentment at
Calabasas and among the Morgan following. Some
of the numerous disaffected were baiting the
stages most of the time. They bullied the guards,
fought the passengers, and fomented discontent
among the drivers. In all Thief River disturbances,
whether a raid on cattlemen, a stage
hold-up, a gun fight, or a tedious war of words,
the Calabasas men, sometimes apparently for the
mere maintaining of prestige, appeared to take
leading r&ocirc;les. After de Spain&#8217;s declaration the
grievance against Elpaso was made a general one
along the line. His stage was singled out and
ridden at times both by Sandusky and Logan&ndash;&ndash;the
really dangerous men of the Spanish Sinks&ndash;&ndash;and
by Gale Morgan and Sassoon to stir up
trouble.</p>
<p>But old Frank Elpaso was far from being a
fool. A fight with any one of these men meant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
that somebody would be killed, and no one could
tell just who, Elpaso shrewdly reckoned, until
the roll-call at the end of it. He therefore met
truculence with diplomacy, threatening looks with
flattery, and hard words with a long story. Moreover,
all Calabasas knew that Elpaso, if he had
to, would fight, and that the eccentric guard was
not actually to be cornered with impunity. Even
Logan, who, like Sandusky, was known to be without
fear and without mercy, felt at least a respect
for Elpaso&#8217;s shortened shotgun, and stopped
this side actual hostilities with him. When the
June clean-up of the No. 2 Thief River mine came
through&ndash;&ndash;one hundred and six thousand dollars
in gold bullion under double guard&ndash;&ndash;and a Calabasas
contingent of night-riders tried to stop the
treasure, rumor along the Sinks had it that Elpaso&#8217;s
slugs, delivered at the right moment, were
responsible for Deaf Sandusky&#8217;s long illness at
Bear Dance, and the failure of the subsequent
masked attack on the up stage.</p>
<p>Sassoon, however, owing to the indignity now
put upon him, also nourished a particular grievance
against the meditative guard, and his was
one not tempered either by prudence or calculation.
His chance came one night when Elpaso
had unwisely allowed himself to be drawn into a
card game at Calabasas Inn. Elpaso was notoriously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
a stickler for a square deal at cards.
He was apparently the only man at Calabasas
that hoped for such a thing, and certainly the
only one so rash as to fight for it&ndash;&ndash;yet he always
did. A dispute on this occasion found him without
a friend in the room. Sassoon reached for
him with a knife.</p>
<p>McAlpin was the first to get the news at the
barn. He gave first aid to the helpless guard, and,
without dreaming he could be got to a surgeon
alive, rushed him in a light wagon to the hospital
at Sleepy Cat, where it was said that he must
have more lives than a wildcat. Sassoon, not
caring to brave de Spain&#8217;s anger in town, went
temporarily into hiding. A second surgeon was
brought from Medicine Bend, and heroic efforts
were put forth to nurse again into life the feeble
spark the assassin had left in the unlucky guard.</p>
<p>Word of this cutting reached de Spain at Thief
River. He started for Calabasas, learned there
during a brief stop what he could&ndash;&ndash;which was, of
course, next to nothing&ndash;&ndash;of the affray, and posted
on to Sleepy Cat.</p>
<p>A conference was held in Jeffries&#8217;s office. De
Spain, Lefever, and some of the division staff discussed
the situation raised by the affair. De
Spain was instructed to see that Sassoon was
brought in and made an example of for the benefit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
of his Calabasas friends. Accordingly, while
the guard&#8217;s life hung in the balance, the sheriff,
Jim Druel, was despatched after Sassoon. A
great deal of inquiry, much riding, and a lot of
talk on Druel&#8217;s part accomplished nothing.</p>
<p>Lefever spoiled with impatience to get after
Sassoon. &#8220;The only way we&#8217;ll ever get one of
that gang is to go for him ourselves,&#8221; said he.
The sheriff&#8217;s campaign did collapse. Sassoon
could not be found although rumor was notorious
that he continued to haunt Calabasas. Lefever&#8217;s
irritation grew. &#8220;Never mind, John,&#8221; counselled
de Spain, &#8220;forget about wanting him.
Sometime one of us will stumble on him, and when
we do we&#8217;ll shackle him.&#8221; The precaution was
taken, meantime, to secure a warrant for the
missing man, together with authority for either
of the two to serve it. Elpaso, in the end, justified
his old reputation by making a recovery&ndash;&ndash;haltingly,
it is true, and with perilous intervals of
sinking, but a recovery.</p>
<p>It was while he still lay in the hospital and
hope was very low that de Spain and Lefever
rode, one hot morning, into Calabasas and were
told by McAlpin that Sassoon had been seen
within five minutes at the inn. To Lefever the
news was like a bubbling spring to a thirsty man.
His face beamed, he tightened his belt, shook out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
his gun, and looked with benevolent interest on
de Spain, who stood pondering. &#8220;If you will
stay right here, Henry,&#8221; he averred convincingly,
&#8220;I will go over and get Sassoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief stage-guard, Bob Scott, the Indian,
was in the barn. He smiled at Lefever&#8217;s enthusiasm.
&#8220;Sassoon,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is slippery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better let us go along and see you do
it,&#8221; suggested de Spain, who with the business in
hand grew thoughtful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I thank you,&#8221; protested Lefever,
raising one hand in deprecation, the other resting
lightly on his holster. &#8220;We still have some <i>little</i>
reputation to maintain along the Sinks. Don&#8217;t
let us make it a <i>posse</i> for <i>Sassoon</i>.&#8221; No one opposed
him further, and he rode away alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be any trouble for John to bring Sassoon
in,&#8221; murmured Scott, who spoke with a
smile and in the low tone and deliberate manner
of the Indian, &#8220;if he can find him.&#8221;</p>
<p>With de Spain, Scott remained in front of the
barn, saddled horses in hand. They could see
nothing of the scene of action, and de Spain was
forced in idleness to curb his impatience. Lefever
rode down to the inn without seeing a living
thing anywhere about it. When he dismounted
in front he thought he heard sounds within the
barroom, but, pushing open the door and looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
circumspectly into the room before entering, he
was surprised to find it empty.</p>
<p>There was something, under the circumstances
and in the stimulus of danger, almost uncanny in
the silence, the absence of any life whatever about
the place. Lefever walked cautiously inside; there
seemed no need of caution. No one was there
to confront or oppose him. Surveying the interior
with a rapid glance, he walked to the left
end of the bar and, gun in readiness, looked apprehensively
behind it. Not so much as a strainer
was to be seen underneath. He noticed, however,
that the sash of the low window on his left, which
looked into the patio, was open, and two heel-marks
in the hard clay suggested that a man
might have jumped through. Whether these were
Sassoon&#8217;s heels or another&#8217;s, Lefever decided they
constituted his clew, and, running out of the front
door, he sprang into his saddle and rode to where
he could signal de Spain and Scott to come up.</p>
<p>He told his story as they joined him, and the
three returned to the inn. Scott rode directly to
the rear. Lefever took de Spain in to the bar,
showed him the open sash, and pointed to the
heel-prints. De Spain stepped through the window,
Lefever following. An examination showed
the slide of a spur-rowel behind one heel-mark
and indications of a hasty jump.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>While they bent over the signs that seemed to
connect their quarry with the place, a door
opened across the courtyard, and Pedro appeared.
He was curiously dense to all inquiries,
and Lefever, convinced that Sassoon was somewhere
at hand, revenged himself by searching the
place.</p>
<p>In the dark kitchen a very old woman and a
slovenly girl were at work. No one else was to
be found anywhere.</p>
<p>De Spain, who was the more experienced tracker,
thought he could follow the footprints to the
arched opening across the patio. This was closed
only by a swinging gate, and afforded easy escape
from a pursuer. At some distance outside this
gate, as de Spain threw it open, sat Bob Scott on
his horse. De Spain made inquiry of Scott. No
one had been seen. Returning to Lefever, who,
greatly chagrined, had convinced himself that
Sassoon had got away, de Spain called Scott into
the patio.</p>
<p>A better tracker than either of his companions,
Scott after a minute confirmed their belief that
Sassoon must have escaped by the window. He
then took the two men out to where some one,
within a few minutes, had mounted a horse and
galloped off.</p>
<p>&#8220;But where has he gone?&#8221; demanded Lefever,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
pointing with his hand. &#8220;There is the road both
ways for three miles.&#8221; Scott nodded toward the
snow-capped peak of Music Mountain. &#8220;Over
to Morgan&#8217;s, most likely. He knows no one
would follow him into the Gap. Just for fun,
now, let&#8217;s see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dismounting, the Indian scrutinized the hoof-prints
where the horse had stood. Getting into
the saddle again, he led the way, bending over his
horse&#8217;s neck and stopping frequently to read the
trail, half a mile out along the Gap road, until he
could once more readily point out the hoof-prints
to his companions. &#8220;That is Sassoon,&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;I know the heels. And I know he
rides this horse; it belongs to Gale Morgan.
Sassoon,&#8221; Scott smiled sympathetically on Lefever,
&#8220;is half-way to Morgan&#8217;s Gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After him!&#8221; cried Lefever hotly. De Spain
looked inquiringly at the guard. Scott shook his
head. &#8220;That would be all right, but there&#8217;s two
other Calabasas men in the Gap this afternoon it
wouldn&#8217;t be nice to mix with&ndash;&ndash;Deaf Sandusky
and Harvey Logan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t mix with them,&#8221; suggested de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we tackle Sassoon, they&#8217;ll mix with us,&#8221;
explained Scott. He reflected a moment. &#8220;They
always stay at Gale Morgan&#8217;s or Duke&#8217;s. We
might sneak Sassoon out without their getting on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
Sassoon knows he is safe in the Gap; but he&#8217;ll
hide even after he gets there. He takes two precautions
for every other man&#8217;s one. Sassoon is
a wonder at hiding out. I&#8217;ve got the Thief
River run this afternoon&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain looked at him. &#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott&#8217;s face softened into the characteristic
smile&ndash;&ndash;akin to a quiet grin&ndash;&ndash;that it often wore.
&#8220;If I didn&#8217;t have to go through to-day, and the
three of us could get to the Gap before daylight
to-morrow morning, I would give Sassoon a run
for his money in spite of the other fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take your run this afternoon,&#8221; directed
de Spain. &#8220;Telephone Sleepy Cat for a substitute.
Suppose we go back, get something to eat,
and you two ride singly over toward the Gap
this afternoon; lie outside under cover to see
whether Sassoon or his friends leave before night&ndash;&ndash;there&#8217;s
only one way out of the place, they
tell me. Then I will join you, and we&#8217;ll ride in
before daylight, and perhaps catch him while
everybody is asleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do,&#8221; predicted Scott, in his deliberate
way of expressing a conclusion, &#8220;I think you&#8217;ll
get him.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was so arranged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>ROUNDING UP SASSOON</h3>
</div>
<p>De Spain joined his associates at dark outside
the Gap. Neither Sassoon nor his
friends had been seen. The night was still, the
sky cloudless, and as the three men with a led
horse rode at midnight into the mountains, the
great red heart of the Scorpion shone afire in the
southern sky. Spreading out when they rode
between the mountain walls, they made their
way without interruption silently toward their
rendezvous, an aspen grove near which Purgatoire
Creek makes its way out of the Gap and,
cutting a deep gash along the edge of the range
for a hundred miles, empties into the Thief.</p>
<p>Scott was the first to reach the trees. The
little grove spreads across a slope half a mile
wide between the base of one towering cliff, still
bearing its Spanish name, El Capitan, and the
gorge of the Purgatoire. To the east of this
point the trails to Calabasas and to Sleepy Cat
divide, and here Scott and Lefever received de
Spain, who had ridden slowly and followed Scott&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
injunctions to keep the red star to the right of
El Capitan all the way across the Sinks.</p>
<p>Securing their horses, the three stretched out
on the open ground to wait for daylight. De
Spain was wakeful, and his eyes rested with curiosity
on the huge bulk of Music Mountain, rising
overwhelmingly above him. Through the Gap
that divided the great, sentinel-like front of El
Capitan, marking the northern face of the mountain
rift, from Round Top, the south wall of the
opening, stars shone vividly, as if lighting the way
into the silent range beyond.</p>
<p>The breathing of his companions soon assured
de Spain that both were asleep. The horses were
quiet, and the night gave no sound save that
vaguely through the darkness came the faint brawl
of tiny cataracts tumbling down far mountain
heights. De Spain, lying on his side, his head
resting on his elbow, and his hands clasped at
the back of his neck, meditated first on how he
should capture Sassoon at daybreak, and then on
Nan Morgan and her mountain home, into which
he was about to break to drag out a criminal.
Sassoon and his malice soon drifted out of his
mind, but Nan remained. She stayed with him,
it seemed, for hours&ndash;&ndash;appearing and disappearing,
in one aspect more alluring than another. Then
her form outlined in the mists that rose from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
hidden creek seemed to hover somewhere near
until Scott&#8217;s hand laid on the dreamer&#8217;s shoulder
drove it suddenly away. Day was at hand.</p>
<p>De Spain got up and shook off the chilliness
and drowsiness of the night. It had been agreed
that he, being less known in the Gap than either
of his companions, could best attempt the difficult
capture. It was strictly a <i>coup de main</i>,
depending for its success on chance and nerve.
The one that tried it might manage to bring out
his man&ndash;&ndash;or might be brought out himself. Between
these alternatives there was not much middle
ground, except that failing to find Sassoon,
or in case he should be intercepted with his prisoner,
the intruder, escaping single-handed from
a shower of bullets, might still get away. But
Morgan&#8217;s Gap men were esteemed fairly good
marksmen.</p>
<p>Bob Scott, who knew the recess well, repeated
his explicit directions as to how de Spain was to
reach Sassoon&#8217;s shack. He repeated his description
of its interior, told him where the bed stood,
and even where Sassoon ordinarily kept his knife
and his revolver. The western sky was still dark
when de Spain, mounting, discussed the last arrangements
with his scouts and, taking the bridle
of the led horse, turned toward Round Top. At
its narrowest point the Gap opening is barely two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
miles wide, and the one road, in and out, lies
among the rocks through this neck; toward it
all trails inside the Gap converge. De Spain
gave his horse his head&ndash;&ndash;it was still too dark to
distinguish the path&ndash;&ndash;and depended on his towering
landmarks for his general direction. He advanced
at a snail&#8217;s pace until he passed the base
of El Capitan, when of a sudden, as he rode out
from among high projecting rocks full into the
opening, faint rays of light from the eastern dawn
revealed the narrow, strangely enclosed and perfectly
hidden valley before him. The eastern and
southern sides still lay in darkness, but the stupendous
cliffs frowning on the north and west
were lighted somewhat from the east. The
southern wall, though shrouded, seemed to rise
in an unending series of beetling ar&ecirc;tes.</p>
<p>De Spain caught his breath. No description
he had ever heard of the nook that screened the
Morgans from the outside world had prepared
him for what he saw. From side to side of the
gigantic mountain fissure, it could hardly be, de
Spain thought, more than a few thousand yards&ndash;&ndash;so
completely was his sense of proportion
stunned by the frowning cliffs which rose, at
points, half a mile into the sky. But it was actually
several miles from wall to wall, and the Gap
was more than as much in depth, as it ran back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
to a mere wedge between unnamed Superstition
peaks.</p>
<p>Every moment that he pushed ahead warned
him that daylight would come suddenly and his
time to act would be short. The trail he followed
broadened into a road, and he strained his eyes for
signs, first of life, and then of habitation. The
little creek, now beside his way, flowed quietly
albeit swiftly along, and his utmost vigilance
could detect no living thing stirring; but a turn
in the trail, marked by a large pine-tree and conforming
to a bend of the stream, brought him
up startled and almost face to face with a long,
rambling ranch-house. The gable end of the two-story
portion of the building was so close to him
that he instantly reined up to seek hiding from
its upper and lower windows.</p>
<p>From Scott&#8217;s accurate description he knew the
place. This was Duke Morgan&#8217;s ranch-house,
set as a fortress almost at the mouth of the Gap.
To pass it unobserved was to compass the most
ticklish part of his mission, and without changing
his slow pace he rode on, wondering whether a
bullet, if fired from any of the low, open windows&ndash;&ndash;which
he could almost throw his hat into as
he trotted past&ndash;&ndash;would knock him off his horse
or leave him a chance to spur away. But no bullet
challenged him and no sound came from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
silent house. He cantered away from the peril,
thinking with a kind of awe of Nan, asleep, so
close, under that roof&ndash;&ndash;confident, too, he had not
been seen&ndash;&ndash;though, in matter of fact, he had been.</p>
<p>He quickened his pace. The place he wanted
to reach was more than a mile distant. Other
cabins back toward the north wall could be seen
dimly to his right, but all were well removed from
his way. He found, in due time, the ford in the
creek, as Scott had advised, made it without mishap,
scrambled up a steep and rocky path, and
saw confronting him, not far ahead, a small,
ruinous-looking cabin shack. Dismounting before
this, he threw his lines, shook himself a
little, and walked up to the cabin door. It was
open.</p>
<p>The mild-minded conspirators who had planned
the details of the abduction were agreed that if
the effort could be made a success at all, there
was but one way to effect it, and that was to act,
in every step, openly. Any attempt to steal on
Sassoon unawares would be a desperate one;
while to walk boldly into his cabin at daybreak
would be to do only what his companions were
likely at any time to do, and was the course least
calculated to lead to serious trouble. None of the
three were unaware of the psychological action
of that peculiar instinct of danger possessed by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
men habitually exposed to surprise&ndash;&ndash;they knew
how easily it may be aroused in a sleeper by the
unusual happening about him, and how cunningly
it is allayed by counterfeiting within his hearing
the usual course of normal events.</p>
<p>De Spain, following the chosen policy, called
gruffly to the cabin inmate. There was no answer.
All had sounded extremely plausible to
de Spain at the time he listened to Bob Scott&#8217;s
ingenious anticipation of the probabilities, and
he had felt while listening to the subtle Indian
that the job was not a complicated one.</p>
<p>But now, as he hitched his trouser band near
to the butt of his revolver with his right hand,
and laid his left on the jamb of the door with an
effort to feel at home, stepped unevenly across
the threshold, and tried to peer into the interior
darkness, Scott&#8217;s strategy did not, for some reason,
commend itself quite so convincingly to him.
There seemed, suddenly, a great many chances
for a slip in the programme. De Spain coughed
slightly, his eyes meantime boring the darkness
to the left, where Sassoon&#8217;s bed should be. The
utmost scrutiny failed to disclose any sign of it
or any sound of breathing from that corner. He
took a few steps toward where the man should be
asleep, and perceived beyond a doubt that there
was no bed in the corner at all. He turned toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
the other corner, his hand covering the butt of
his gun. &#8220;Hello, Shike!&#8221; he called out in a
slightly strained tone of camaraderie, addressing
Sassoon by a common nickname. Then he listened.
A trumpeting snore answered. No sound
was ever sweeter to de Spain&#8217;s ear. The rude
noise cleared the air and steadied the intruder as
if Music Mountain itself had been lifted off his
nerves.</p>
<p>He tried again: &#8220;Where are you, Shike?&#8221; he
growled. &#8220;What&#8217;s this stuff on the floor?&#8221; he
continued, shuffling his way ostentatiously to the
other side of the room. But his noise-making was
attended with the utmost caution. He had
dropped, like a shot, flat on the floor and crawled,
feeling his way, to the opposite side of the room,
only to find, after much trouble, that the bed in
the darkness was there, but it was empty. De
Spain rose. For a moment he was nonplussed.
An inside room remained, but Scott had said there
was no bed within it. He felt his way toward
the inner door. This was where he expected to
find it, and it was closed. He laid a hand gingerly
on the latch. &#8220;Where are you, Shike?&#8221; he demanded
again, this time with an impatient expletive
summoned for the occasion. A second
fearful snore answered him. De Spain, relieved,
almost laughed as he pushed the door open,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
though not sure whether a curse or a shot would
greet him. He got neither. And a welcome surprise
in the dim light came through a stuffy pane
of glass at one end of the room. It revealed at
the other end a man stretched asleep on a wall
bunk&ndash;&ndash;a man that would, in all likelihood, have
heard the stealthiest sound had any effort been
made to conceal it, but to whose ears the rough
voices of a mountain cabin are mere sleeping-potions.</p>
<p>The sleeper was destined, a moment later, to
a ruder awakening than even his companion outlaws
ever gave him. Lying unsuspectingly on
his back, he woke to feel a hand laid lightly on his
shoulder. The instinct of self-preservation acted
like a flash. His eyes opened and his hands
struck out like cat&#8217;s paws to the right and left:
no knife and no revolver met them. Instead, in
the semidarkness a strange face bent over him.
His fists shot out together, only to be caught in
a vise that broke his arms in two at the elbows,
and forced them back against his throat. Like
lightning, he threw up his knees, drew himself
into a heap, and shot himself out, hands, arms,
legs, back, everything into one terrific spring.
But the sinewy vise above only gave for the shock,
then it closed again relentlessly in. A knee, like
an anvil, pushed inexorably into his stomach and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
heart and lungs. Another lay across his right
arm, and his struggling left arm he could not,
though his eyes burst with the strain from their
sockets, release from where, eagle-like claws
gripped at his throat and shut off his breath.</p>
<p>Again and again, with the fury of desperation,
Sassoon drew in his powerful frame, shot it out,
twisted and struggled. Great veins swelled on
his forehead, his breath burst in explosive gasps,
he writhed from side to side&ndash;&ndash;it was all one.
After every effort the cruel fingers at his throat
tightened. The heavy knee on his chest crushed
more relentlessly. He lay still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you awake, Shike?&#8221; Sassoon heard from
the gloom above him. But he could not place
the voice. &#8220;You seem to move around a good
deal in your sleep. If you&#8217;re awake, keep still.
I&#8217;ve come from Sleepy Cat to get you. Don&#8217;t
mind looking for your gun and knife. Two men
are with me. You can have your choice. We&#8217;ve
got a horse for you. You can ride away from us
here inside the Gap, and take what hits you in
the back, or you can go to Sleepy Cat with us
and stand your trial. I&#8217;ll read your warrant
when the sun gets a little higher. Get up and
choose quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sassoon could not see who had subdued him,
nor did he take long to decide what to do. Scott
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
had predicted he would go without much fuss, and
de Spain, now somewhat surprised, found Bob
right in his forecast. With less trouble than he
expected, the captor got his man sullenly on horseback,
and gave him severely plain directions as
to what not to do. Sassoon, neither bound nor
gagged, was told to ride his horse down the Gap
closely ahead of de Spain and neither to speak
nor turn his head no matter what happened
right or left. To get him out in this manner was,
de Spain realized, the really ticklish part of the
undertaking.</p>
<p>Fortune, however, seemed to favor his assurance
in invading the lions&#8217; den. In the growing
light the two men trotted smartly a mile down the
trail without encountering a sign of life. When
they approached the Morgan ranch-house de
Spain again felt qualms. But he rode close to
his prisoner, told him in restrained monologue
what would happen if he made a noise, and even
held him back in his pace as they trotted together
past the Gap stronghold. Nevertheless, he
breathed more freely when they left the house behind
and the turn in the road put them out of
range of its windows. He closed up the distance
between himself and Sassoon, riding close in to
his side, and looked back at the house. He
looked quickly, but though his eyes were off his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
path and his prisoner for only a fraction of a
second, when he looked ahead again he saw confronting
him, not a hundred yards away, a motionless
horseman.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>HEELS FOR IT</h3>
</div>
<p>With a sudden, low command to Sassoon to
check his horse, and without a movement
that could be detected in the dawn ten yards
away, de Spain with the thumb and finger of
his right hand lifted his revolver from its scabbard,
shifted his lines from his left hand to his
right, rode closer to Sassoon and pressed the
muzzle of the gun to his prisoner&#8217;s side. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got one chance yet, Shike, to ride out of here
alive,&#8221; he said composedly. &#8220;You know I am a
rustler&ndash;&ndash;cousin of John Rebstock&#8217;s. My name is
&#8216;Frenchy&#8217;; I belong in Williams Cache. I rode
in last night from Thief River, and you are riding
out with me to start me on to the Sleepy Cat
trail. If you can remember that much&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>While he spoke to Sassoon his eyes were fixed
on the rider halted in their path. De Spain
stopped half-way through his sentence. The figure
revealed in the half-light puzzled him at first.
Then it confused and startled him. He saw it
was not a man at all, but a woman&ndash;&ndash;and a woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
than whom he would rather have seen six men.
It was Nan Morgan.</p>
<p>With her head never more decisively set under
her mannish hat, her waist never more attractively
outlined in slenderness, she silently faced de
Spain in the morning gray. His face reflected his
chagrined perplexity. The whole fabric of his
slender plot seemed to go to pieces at the sight
of her. At the mere appearance of his frail and
motionless foe a feeling of awkward helplessness
dissolved his easy confidence. He now reversed
every move he had so carefully made with his
hands and, resentfully eying Nan, rode in somewhat
behind Sassoon, doing nothing further than
to pull his kerchief up about his neck, and wondering
what would be likely to happen before the
next three minutes were up. Beyond that flash
the future held no interest for him&ndash;&ndash;his wits had
temporarily failed.</p>
<p>Of one thing he felt assured, that it was in no
wise up to him to speak or do first. He could already
see Nan&#8217;s eyes. They were bent keenly first
on him, then on his companion, and again on him.
De Spain kept his face down as much as he dared,
and his hat had been pulled well over it from the
beginning. She waited so long before accosting
the two men that de Spain, who was ready to
hope any improbable thing, began to hope she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
might let them pass unchallenged. He had resolved,
if she did not speak to push past without
even looking at her. They were now almost
abreast. His fine resolution went smash overboard.
The very instinctive knowledge that her
eyes were bent on his made him steal a glance at
her in spite of himself. The next instant he was
shamefacedly touching his hat. Though nothing
was lost on her, Nan professed not to see the greeting.
He even continued to dream she did not
recognize him. Her eyes, in fact, were directed
toward Sassoon, and when she spoke her tone was
dry with suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a moment, Sassoon. Where are you
going?&#8221; she demanded. Sassoon hitched with
one hand at his trousers band. He inclined his
head sulkily toward his companion. &#8220;Starting
a man on the trail for Sleepy Cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&#8221; she exclaimed sharply, for de Spain,
pushing his own horse ahead, had managed without
being observed, to kick Sassoon&#8217;s horse in the
flank, and the two were passing. Sassoon at the
resolute summons stopped. De Spain could do
no less; both men, halting, faced their suspicious
inquisitor. She scrutinized de Spain keenly.
&#8220;What is this man doing in the Gap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He come up from Thief River last night,&#8221;
answered Sassoon monotonously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What is he doing here with you?&#8221; persisted
Nan.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a cousin of John Rebstock&#8217;s from Williams
Cache,&#8221; continued Sassoon. The yarn
would have sounded decently well in the circumstances
for which it was intended, but in the
searching gaze of the eyes now confronting and
clearly recognizing him, it sounded so grotesque
that de Spain would fully as lief have been sitting
between his horse&#8217;s legs as astride his back.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true, Sassoon,&#8221; said his relentless
questioner. Her tone and the expression of her
face boded no friendliness for either of the two
she had intercepted.</p>
<p>De Spain had recovered his wits. &#8220;You&#8217;re
right,&#8221; he interposed without an instant&#8217;s hesitation.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t true. But that&#8217;s not his fault;
he is under arrest, and is telling you what I told
him to tell you. I came in here this morning to
take Sassoon to Sleepy Cat. He is a prisoner,
wanted for cutting up one of our stage-guards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan, coldly sceptical, eyed de Spain. &#8220;And do
you try to tell me&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;she pointed to Sassoon&#8217;s
unbound hands&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;that he is riding out of here,
a free man, to go to jail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do tell you exactly that. He is my prisoner&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe either of you,&#8221; declared Nan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
scornfully. &#8220;You are planning something underhand
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain laughed coolly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve planned that
much together, but not, I assure you, with his
consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe your stories at all,&#8221; she declared
firmly.</p>
<p>De Spain flushed. The irritation and the serious
danger bore in on him. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t believe
me it&#8217;s not my fault,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
told you the truth. Ride on, Sassoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke angrily, but this in no wise daunted
Nan. She wheeled her horse directly in front of
them. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you stir, Sassoon,&#8221; she commanded,
&#8220;until I call Uncle Duke.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain spurred straight at her; their horses
collided, and his knee touched hers in the saddle.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take this man out of here,&#8221; he announced
in a tone she never had heard before
from a man. &#8220;I&#8217;ve no time to talk. Go call
your uncle if you like. We must pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t pass a step!&#8221;</p>
<p>With the quick words of defiance the two glared
at each other. De Spain was taken aback. He
had expected no more than a war of words&ndash;&ndash;a few
screams at the most. Nan&#8217;s face turned white,
but there was no symptom even of a whimper.
He noticed her quick breathing, and felt, instinctively,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
the restrained gesture of her right hand
as it started back to her side. The move steadied
him. &#8220;One question,&#8221; he said bluntly, &#8220;are you
armed?&#8221;</p>
<p>She hated even to answer, and met his searching
gaze resentfully, but something in his tone
and manner wrung a reply. &#8220;I can defend myself,&#8221;
she exclaimed angrily.</p>
<p>De Spain raised his right hand from his thigh
to the pommel of his saddle. The slight gesture
was eloquent of his surrender of the issue of force.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t go into a shooting-match with you about
this cur. If you call your uncle there will be
bloodshed&ndash;&ndash;unless you drop me off my horse
right here and now before he appears. All I ask
you is this: Is this kind of a cutthroat worth
that? If you shoot me, my whole posse from
Sleepy Cat is right below us in the aspens. Some
of your own people will be killed in a general
fight. If you want to shoot me, shoot&ndash;&ndash;you can
have the match all to yourself. If you don&#8217;t,
let us go by. And if I&#8217;ve told you one word that
isn&#8217;t true, call me back to this spot any time you
like, and I&#8217;ll come at your call, and answer for
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His words and his manner confounded her for
a moment. She could not at once make an answer,
for she could not decide what to say. Then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
of a sudden, she was robbed of her chance to answer.
From down the trail came a yell like a shot.
The clatter of hoofs rang out, and men on horses
dashed from the entrance of the Gap toward them.
De Spain could not make them out distinctly,
but he knew Lefever&#8217;s yell, and pointed. &#8220;There
they are,&#8221; he exclaimed hurriedly. &#8220;There is the
whole posse. They are coming!&#8221; A shot, followed
closely by a second, rang out from below.
&#8220;Go,&#8221; he cried to Nan. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be shooting
here that I can&#8217;t stop!&#8221; He slapped Sassoon&#8217;s
pony viciously with his hand, yelled loud in answer
to Lefever, and before the startled girl could
collect herself, de Spain, crouching in his saddle,
as a fusillade cracked from Lefever&#8217;s and Scott&#8217;s
revolvers, urged Sassoon&#8217;s horse around Nan&#8217;s,
kicked it violently, spurred past her himself, and
was away. White with consternation and anger,
she steadied herself and looked after the fleeing
pair. Then whirling in her saddle, she ran her
pony back to the ranch-house to give the alarm.</p>
<p>Yelling like half a dozen men, Lefever and Scott,
as de Spain and his prisoner dashed toward them,
separated, let the pair pass, and spurred in behind
to cover the flight and confront any pursuers.
None at the moment threatened, but no words
were exchanged until the whole party, riding fast,
were well past El Capitan and out of the Gap.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
For some unexpressed reason&ndash;&ndash;so strong is the
influence of tradition and reputation&ndash;&ndash;no one of
the three coveted a close encounter with the Morgans
within its walls.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the long heels for it now, boys,&#8221; cried de
Spain. His companions closed up again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Save your horses,&#8221; cautioned Scott, between
strides. &#8220;It&#8217;s a good ways home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make for Calabasas,&#8221; shouted Lefever.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; yelled Scott. &#8220;They would stand us a
siege at Calabasas. While the trail is open make
for the railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>A great globe of dazzling gold burst into the
east above the distant hills. But the glory of the
sunrise called forth no admiration from the three
men hurrying a fourth urgently along the Sleepy
Cat trail. Between breaths de Spain explained
his awkward meeting with Nan, and of the strait
he was in when Lefever&#8217;s strong lungs enabled
him to get away unscratched. But for a gunman
a narrow squeak is as good as a wide one, and
no one found fault with the situation. They had
the advantage&ndash;&ndash;the only question was whether
they could hold it. And while they continued to
cast anxious glances behind, Scott&#8217;s Indian eyes
first perceived signs on the horizon that marked
their pursuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; declared Lefever. &#8220;This is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
little fast for a fat man, anyway.&#8221; He was not
averse, either, to the prospect of a long-range
exchange with the fighting mountaineers. All
drew rein a little. &#8220;Suppose I cover the rear till
we see what this is,&#8221; suggested Lefever, limbering
up as the other two looked back. &#8220;Push ahead
with Sassoon. These fellows won&#8217;t follow far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be sure about that,&#8221; muttered Scott.
&#8220;Duke and Gale have got the best horses in the
mountains, and they&#8217;d rather fight than eat.
There they come now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dashing across a plain they themselves had
just crossed, they could see three horsemen in
hot chase. The pursued men rode carefully, and,
scanning the ground everywhere ahead and behind,
de Spain, Scott, and Lefever awaited the
moment when their pursuers should show their
hand. Scott was on the west of the line, and
nearest the enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are they, Bob?&#8221; yelled Lefever.</p>
<p>Scott scrutinized the pursuers carefully. &#8220;One,&#8221;
he called back, &#8220;that big fellow on the right, is
Deaf Sandusky, sure. Harvey Logan, likely, the
middle man. The other I can&#8217;t make out.
Look!&#8221; he exclaimed, pointing to the foot-hills
on their distant left. Two men, riding out almost
abreast of them, were running their horses
for a small canyon through which the trail led
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
two miles ahead. &#8220;Some riding,&#8221; cried Scott,
watching the newcomers. &#8220;That farther man
must be Gale Morgan. They are trying for the
greasewood canyon, to cut us off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stand for that,&#8221; decided de Spain,
surveying the ground around them. &#8220;There&#8217;s
not so much as a sage-brush here for cover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever pointed to his right; at some distance a
dark, weather-beaten cone rose above the yellow
desert. &#8220;Let&#8217;s make a stand in the lava beds,&#8221;
he cried.</p>
<p>De Spain hesitated. &#8220;It takes us the wrong
way.&#8221; He pointed ahead. &#8220;Give them a run
for that canyon, boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Urging their horses, the Sleepy Cat men rode at
utmost speed to beat the flanking party to the
trail gateway. For a few minutes it looked an
even break between pursuers and pursued. The
two men in the foot-hills now had a long angle to
overcome, but they were doing a better pace
than those of the Gap party behind, and half-way
to the canyon it looked like a neck-and-neck heat
for the narrow entrance. Lefever complained of
the effort of keeping up, and at length reined in
his horse. &#8220;Drop me here on the alkali, boys,&#8221;
he cried to the others. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hold this end while
you get through the canyon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; declared de Spain, checking his pace.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
&#8220;If one stays, all stay. This is as good a time as
any to find out what these fellows mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not a very good place,&#8221; commented
Scott, as they slowed, looking for a depression.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as good for us as it is for them,&#8221; returned
de Spain abruptly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll try it right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung out of his saddle, Lefever and Scott
after an instant&#8217;s reconnoissance following. Sassoon
they dismounted. Scott lashed his wrists
together, while de Spain and Lefever unslung
their carbines, got their horses down, and, facing
the west and south, spread themselves on the
ground.</p>
<p>The men behind lost nothing of the defensive
movement of the pursued party, and slowed up
in turn. For the moment the flankers were out
of sight, but they must soon appear on the crest
of a rise between them and the canyon. Lefever
was first down and first ready with his rifle to
cover the men behind. These now spread out
and came on, as if for a rush.</p>
<p>Lefever, picking Logan, the foremost, sent a
warning shot in front of him. De Spain fired almost
at the same moment toward the big man
making a d&eacute;tour to the right of the leader. The
two bullets puffed in the distant alkali, and the
two horsemen, sharply admonished, swerved backward
precipitately. After a momentary circling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
indecision, the three rode closer together for a
conference, dismounted, and opened a return fire
on the little party lying to.</p>
<p>The strategy of their halt and their firing was
not hard to penetrate. The men from the foot-hills
were still riding for the canyon. No views
were exchanged among Sassoon&#8217;s captors, but all
understood that this move must be stopped.
Lefever and Scott, without words, merely left
the problem to de Spain as the leader. He lay
on the right of the line as they faced south, and
this brought him nearest to the riders out of the
foot-hills. Taking advantage of a lull in the firing,
he pulled his horse around between himself and
the attacking party, and in such a position that
he could command with his rifle the fast-moving
riders to the west.</p>
<p>Something of a predicament confronted him.
He was loath to take a human life in the effort
to get a cutthroat jailed, and hated even to
cripple a beast for it, but the two men must be
stopped. Nor was it easy to pick up the range
offhand, but meaning that the Morgans, if they
were Morgans, should understand how a rush
would be met, he sent one shot after another,
short, beyond, and ahead of the horsemen, to
check them, and to feel the way for closer shooting
if it should be necessary. The two dashed on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
undaunted. De Spain perceived that warnings
were wasted. He lowered his sights, and, waiting
his chance as the leader of the foot-hill pursuers
rode into a favorable range, he fired for his horse&#8217;s
head. The beast jumped convulsively and pitched
forward, head down in a half somersault, throwing
his rider violently to the ground. Scott and
Lefever yelled loudly.</p>
<p>Out of the cloud of dust the man scrambled
to his feet, looked coolly around, and brushed the
alkali disgustedly from his eyes just as a second
bullet from de Spain tore up the earth a few feet
to one side of him. He jumped like a rabbit at
this summons, and did not even make a further
pretense at composure. Grabbing his hat from
the ground, he ran like mad toward the hills.
Meantime his mounted companion had turned
about. De Spain sprang to his feet, jerked up his
horse and cried: &#8220;Now for the canyon!&#8221; Pushing
Sassoon into the saddle and profiting by the
confusion, the railroad men rode hard for their
refuge, and reached it without more molestation
than an occasional shot from their distant pursuers
on the main trail. De Spain and his scouts
now felt assured of their escape. The foot-hills
contingent was left far behind, and, though their
remaining pursuers rode in at times with a show
of rushing, the chase was a stern one, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
could be checked whenever necessary. Halting
at times in this way to breathe their horses, or to
hold off the rear pursuit, de Spain with his two
companions and their prisoner rode into Sleepy
Cat, locked Sassoon up, and went to the Mountain
House for breakfast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>MAINTAINING A REPUTATION</h3>
</div>
<p>The abduction of Sassoon, which signalized
de Spain&#8217;s entry into the stage-line management,
created a sensation akin to the exploding
of a bomb under the range. The whole mountain
country, which concentrates, sensibly, on
but one topic at a time, talked for a week of
nothing else. No such defiance of the traditions
of the Morgan rule along the reaches of the Spanish
Sinks had been attempted in years&ndash;&ndash;and it
was recalled more than once, when de Spain&#8217;s feat
was discussed at the ranches, on the trails, and in
the haunts of gunmen in Calabasas, that no one
of those who had ever braved the wrath of the
Sink rulers had lived indefinitely to boast of it.</p>
<p>Experienced men, therefore, in the high country&ndash;&ndash;men
of that class who, wherever found, are
old in the ways of the world, and not promptly
moved by new or youthful adventure&ndash;&ndash;dismissed
the incident after hearing the details, with the
comment or the conclusion that there would
hardly be for de Spain more than one additional
chapter to the story, and that this would be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
short one. The most active Morgans&ndash;&ndash;Gale,
Duke, and the easy-going Satterlee&ndash;&ndash;were indeed
wrought to the keenest pitch of revengeful anger.
No question of the right or wrong of the arrest
was discussed&ndash;&ndash;justification was not considered.
It was an overwhelmingly insolent invasion&ndash;&ndash;and
worst of all, a successful invasion, by one who
had nothing but cool impudence, not even a budding
reputation to justify his assault on the lifelong
prestige of the Gap clan. Gale Morgan
strode and rode the streets of Sleepy Cat looking
for de Spain, and storming.</p>
<p>De Spain himself, somewhat surprised at the
storm he had kicked up, heeded the counsel of
Scott, and while the acute stage of the resentment
raged along the trail he ran down for a
few days to Medicine Bend to buy horses. Both
Gale and Duke Morgan proclaimed, in certain
public places in Sleepy Cat, their intention of
shooting de Spain on sight; and as a climax to
all the excitement of the week following his capture,
the slippery Sassoon broke jail and, after a
brief interval, appeared at large in Calabasas.</p>
<p>This feat of the Morgan satellite made a loud
laugh at de Spain&#8217;s expense. It mitigated somewhat
the humiliation of Sassoon&#8217;s friends, but
it in no wise diminished their expressed resolve
to punish de Spain&#8217;s invasion. Lefever, who as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
the mixer among the stage men, kept close to
the drift of public sentiment, decided after de
Spain&#8217;s return to Sleepy Cat that the stage-line
authorities had gained nothing by Sassoon&#8217;s
capture.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to have thought of it before,
Henry,&#8221; he said frankly one night in Jeffries&#8217;s
office, &#8220;but we didn&#8217;t think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning just what, John?&#8221; demanded de
Spain without real interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning, that in this country you can&#8217;t begin
on a play like pulling Sassoon out from under
his friends&#8217; noses without keeping up the pace&ndash;&ndash;without
a second and third act. You dragged
Sassoon by his hair out of the Gap; good. You
surprised everybody; good. But you can&#8217;t very
well stop at that, Henry. You have raised hopes,
you have led people to invest you with the faint
glimmerings of a reputation. I say, the glimmerings,
because such a feat by itself doesn&#8217;t insure
a permanent reputation, Henry. It is, so to say,
merely a &#8216;demand&#8217; reputation&ndash;&ndash;one that men reserve
the right to recall at any moment. And the
worst of it is, if they ever do recall it, you are worse
off than when before they extended the brittle
bauble to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jingo, John! For a stage blacksmith you are
some spieler.&#8221; De Spain added an impatient,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
not to say contumelious exclamation concerning
the substance of Lefever&#8217;s talk. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask
them for a reputation. This man interfered with
my guard&ndash;&ndash;in fact, tried to cut his throat, didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would have done it if Frank had been an
honest man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all there is to it, isn&#8217;t it? If Sassoon
or anybody else gets in the way of the stages,
I&#8217;ll go after them again&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s all there is to it,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever tapped the second finger of one fat
hand gently on the table. &#8220;Practically; practically
all, Henry, yes. You don&#8217;t quite understand,
but you have the right idea. What I am
trying to hammer into your dense cocoanut is,
that when a man has, gets, or is given a reputation
out in this country, he has got to live up
to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want me to do&ndash;&ndash;back a horse
and shoot two guns at once up and down Main
Street, cowboy style?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever kept his patience without difficulty.
&#8220;No, no. You&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scott advised me to run down to Medicine
Bend for a few days to let the Morgans cool off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. That was the first step. The few
days are a thing of the past. I suppose you know,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
continued Lefever, in as well-modulated a tone
as he could assume to convey information that
could not be regarded as wholly cheerful, &#8220;that
they expect to get you for this Sassoon job.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain flushed. But the red anger lasted
only a moment. &#8220;Who are &#8216;they&#8217;?&#8221; he asked
after a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deaf Sandusky, Logan, of course, the Calabasas
bunch, and the Morgans.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain regarded his companion unamiably.
&#8220;What do they expect I&#8217;ll be doing while they are
getting me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever raised a hand deprecatingly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be overconfident, Henry; that&#8217;s your danger. I
know you can take care of yourself. All I
want to do is to get the folks here acquainted
with your ability, without taking unnecessary
chances. You see, people are not now asking
questions of one another; they are asking them of
themselves. Who and what is this newcomer&ndash;&ndash;an
accident or a genuine arrival? A common
squib or a real explosion? Don&#8217;t get excited,&#8221;
he added, in an effort to soothe de Spain&#8217;s obvious
irritation. &#8220;You have the idea, Henry. It&#8217;s
time to show yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t very well do business here without
showing myself,&#8221; retorted de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is a thing to be managed,&#8221; persisted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
Lefever. &#8220;Now, suppose&ndash;&ndash;since the topic is up&ndash;&ndash;we
&#8216;show&#8217; in Main Street for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we do,&#8221; echoed de Spain ungraciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will crack the d&eacute;but ice. We will call
at Harry Tenison&#8217;s hotel, and then go to his new
rooms&ndash;&ndash;go right to society headquarters first&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
my theory of doing it. If anybody has
any shooting in mind, Tenison&#8217;s is a quiet and
orderly place. And if a man declines to eat
anybody up at Tenison&#8217;s, we put him down,
Henry, as not ravenously hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One man I would like to see is that sheriff,
Druel, who let Sassoon get out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready to interview him now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some telegrams to answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those will keep. The Morgans are in town.
We&#8217;ll start out and find somebody.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was wet and sloppy outside, but Lefever was
indifferent to the rain, and de Spain thought it
would be undignified to complain of it.</p>
<p>When, followed by Lefever, he walked into the
lobby of Tenison&#8217;s hotel a few moments later the
office was empty. Nevertheless, the news of the
appearance of Sassoon&#8217;s captor spread. The two
sauntered into the billiard-hall, which occupied
a deep room adjoining the office and opened with
large plate-glass windows on Main Street. Every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
table was in use. A fringe of spectators in the
chairs, ostensibly watching the pool games,
turned their eyes toward de Spain&ndash;&ndash;those that
recognized him distinguishing him by nods and
whispers to others.</p>
<p>Among several groups of men standing before
the long bar, one party of four near the front
end likewise engaged the interest of those keener
loafers who were capable of foreseeing situations.
These men, Satterlee Morgan, the cattleman;
Bull Page, one of his cowboys; Sheriff
Druel, and Judge Druel, his brother, had been
drinking together. They did not see Lefever and
his companion as the two came in through the
rear lobby door. But Lefever, on catching sight
of them, welcomed his opportunity. Walking directly
forward, he laid his hand on Satt Morgan&#8217;s
shoulder. As the cattleman turned, Lefever,
genially grasping his hand, introduced de Spain
to each of the party in turn. What followed in
the brief interval between the meeting of the six
men and the sudden breaking up of the group
a few moments later was never clearly known,
but a fairly conclusive theory of it was afterward
accepted by Sleepy Cat.</p>
<p>Morgan threw the brim of his weather-beaten
hat back from his tanned face. He wore a mustache
and a chin whisker of that variety designated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
in the mountains by the most opprobrious
of epithets. But his smile, which drew his cheeks
into wrinkles all about his long, round nose, was
not unfriendly. He looked with open interest
from his frank but not overtrustworthy eyes at
de Spain. &#8220;I heard,&#8221; he said in a good-natured,
slightly nasal tone, &#8220;you made a sunrise call on
us one day last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want to say,&#8221; returned de Spain,
equally amiable, &#8220;that if I had had any idea you
folks would take it so hard&ndash;&ndash;I mean, as an affront
intended to any of you&ndash;&ndash;I never would have gone
into the Gap after Sassoon. I just assumed&ndash;&ndash;making
a mistake as I now realize&ndash;&ndash;that my scrap
would be with Sassoon, not with the Morgans.&#8221;</p>
<p>Satt&#8217;s face wrinkled into a humorous grin.
&#8220;You sure kicked up some alkali.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain nodded candidly. &#8220;More than I intended
to. And I say&ndash;&ndash;without any intention of
impertinence to anybody else&ndash;&ndash;Sassoon is a cur.
I supposed when I brought him in here after so
much riding, that we had sheriff enough to keep
him.&#8221; He looked at Druel with such composure
that the latter for a moment was nonplussed.
Then he discharged a volley of oaths, and demanded
what de Spain meant. De Spain did not
move. He refused to see the angry sheriff.
&#8220;That is where I made my second mistake,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
continued, speaking to Morgan and forcing his
tone just enough to be heard. Druel, with more
hard words, began to abuse the railroad for not
paying taxes enough to build a decent jail. De
Spain took another tack. He eyed the sheriff
calmly as the latter continued to draw away
and left de Spain standing somewhat apart from
the rest of the group. &#8220;Then it may be I am
making another mistake, Druel, in blaming you.
It may not be your fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fault is, you&#8217;re fresh,&#8221; cried Druel, warming
up as de Spain appeared to cool. The line of
tipplers backed away from the bar. De Spain,
stepping toward the sheriff, raised his hand in a
friendly way. &#8220;Druel, you&#8217;re hurting yourself
by your talk. Make me your deputy again
sometime,&#8221; he concluded, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll see that
Sassoon stays where he is put.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just do that,&#8221; cried Druel, with a very
strong word, and he raised his hand in turn.
&#8220;Next time you want him locked up, you can take
care of him yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sharp crack of a rifle cut off the words;
a bullet tore like a lightning-bolt across de Spain&#8217;s
neck, crashed through a mahogany pilaster back
of the bar, and embedded itself in the wall. The
shot had been aimed from the street for his head.
The noisy room instantly hushed. Spectators
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
sat glued to their chairs. White-faced players
leaned motionless against the tables. De Spain
alone had acted; all that the bartenders could
ever remember after the single rifle-shot was seeing
his hand go back as he whirled and shot
instantly toward the heavy report. He had
whipped out his gun and fired sidewise through
the window at the sound.</p>
<p>That was all. The bartenders breathed and
looked again. Men were crowding like mad
through the back doors. De Spain, at the cigar
case, looked intently into the rainy street, lighted
from the corner by a dingy lamp. The four men
near him had not stirred, but, startled and alert,
the right hand of each covered the butt of a revolver.
De Spain moved first. While the pool
players jammed the back doors to escape, he spoke
to, without looking at, the bartender. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the matter with your curtains?&#8221; he demanded,
sheathing his revolver and pointing with an expletive
to the big sheet of plate glass. &#8220;Is this
the way you build up business for the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>Those close enough to the window saw that
the bare pane had been cut, just above the middle,
by two bullet-holes. Curious men examined
both fractures when de Spain and Lefever had
left the saloon. The first hole was the larger. It
had been made by a high-powered rifle; the second
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
was from a bullet of a Colt&#8217;s revolver; it
was remarked as a miracle of gun-play that the
two were hardly an inch apart.</p>
<p>In the street a few minutes later, de Spain and
Lefever encountered Scott, who, with his back
hunched up, his cheap black hat pulled well down
over his ears, his hands in his trousers pockets
and his thin coat collar modestly turned against
the drizzling rain, was walking across the parkway
from the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sassoon is in town,&#8221; exclaimed Lefever with
certainty after he had told the story. He waited
for the Indian&#8217;s opinion. Scott, looking through
the water dripping from the brim of his seasoned
derby, gave it in one word. &#8220;Was,&#8221; he amended
with a quiet smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s make sure,&#8221; insisted Lefever. &#8220;Supposing
he might be in town yet, Bob, where is
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott gazed up the street through the rain
lighted by yellow lamps on the obscure corners,
and looked down the street toward the black
reaches of the river. &#8220;If he&#8217;s here, you&#8217;ll find
him in one of two places. Tenison&#8217;s&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ve just come from Tenison&#8217;s,&#8221; objected
Lefever.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, across the street, up-stairs; or at
Jim Kitchen&#8217;s barn. If he was hurried to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
away,&#8221; added Scott reflectively, &#8220;he would slip
up-stairs over there as the nearest place to hide;
if he had time he would make for the barn, where
it would be easy to cache his rifle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever took the lapel of the scout&#8217;s coat in his
hand. &#8220;Then you, Bob, go out and see if you can
get the whole story. I&#8217;ll take the barn. Let
Henry go over to Tenison&#8217;s and wait at the
head of the stairs till we can get back there. It
is just around the corner&ndash;&ndash;second floor&ndash;&ndash;a dark
hall running back, opposite the double doors that
open into an anteroom. Stay there, Henry, till
we come. It won&#8217;t be long, and if we don&#8217;t get
track of him you may spot your man yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain found no difficulty in locating the
flight of marble stairs that led to the gambling-rooms.
It was the only lighted entrance in the
side street. No light shone at the head of the
stairs, but a doorway on the left opened into a
dimly lighted anteroom and this, in turn, through
a large arch, opened on a large room brilliantly
lighted by chandeliers&ndash;&ndash;one in the centre and one
near each corner. Around three sides of this
room were placed the keno layouts, roulette-wheels,
faro-tables, and minor gambling devices.
Off the casino itself small card-rooms opened.</p>
<p>The big room was well filled for a wet night.
The faro-tables were busy, and at the central table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
at the farther end of the room&ndash;&ndash;the table designated
as Tenison&#8217;s, because, at the rare intervals
in which the proprietor dealt, he presided at this
table&ndash;&ndash;a group watched silently a game in progress.
De Spain took a place in shadow near one
side of the archway facing the street-door and at
times looked within for the loosely jointed frame,
crooked neck, tousled forehead, and malevolent
face of the cattle thief. He could find in the many
figures scattered about the room none resembling
the one he sought.</p>
<p>A man entering the place spoke to another
coming out. De Spain overheard the exchange.
&#8220;Duke got rid of his steers yet?&#8221; asked the first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slow game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man sold quite a bunch this time.
The way he&#8217;s playing now he&#8217;ll last twenty-four
hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain, following the newcomer, strolled into
the room and, beginning at one side, proceeded in
leisurely fashion from wheel to wheel and table to
table inspecting the players. Few looked at him
and none paid any attention to his presence. At
Tenison&#8217;s table he saw in the dealer&#8217;s chair the
large, white, smooth face, dark eyes, and clerical
expression of the proprietor, whose presence meant
a real game and explained the interest of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
idlers crowded about one player whom de Spain,
without getting closer in among the onlookers
than he wanted to, could not see.</p>
<p>Tenison, as de Spain approached, happened to
look wearily up; his face showed the set lines of
a protracted session. He neither spoke nor
nodded to the newcomer, but recognized him
with a mere glance. Then, though his eyes had
rested for only an instant on the new face, he
spoke in an impassive tone across the intervening
heads: &#8220;What happened to your red tie,
Henry?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain put up his hand to his neck, and looked
down at a loose end hanging from his soft cravat.
It had been torn by the bullet meant for his head.
He tucked the end inside his collar. &#8220;A Calabasas
man tried to untie it a few minutes ago. He
missed the knot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tenison did not hear the answer. He had reverted
to his case. De Spain moved on and,
after making the round of the scattered tables,
walked again through the archway into the anteroom,
only to meet, as she stood hesitating and
apparently about to enter the room, Nan Morgan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE GAMBLING-ROOM</h3>
</div>
<p>They confronted each other blankly. To
Nan&#8217;s confusion was added her embarrassment
at her personal appearance. Her hat was
wet, and the limp shoulders of her khaki jacket
and the front of her silk blouse showed the wilting
effect of the rain. In one hand she clutched
wet riding-gloves. Her cheeks, either from the
cold rain or mental stress, fairly burned, and her
eyes, which had seemed when he encountered
her, fired with some resolve, changed to an expression
almost of dismay.</p>
<p>This was hardly for more than an instant.
Then her lips tightened, her eyes dropped, and
she took a step to one side to avoid de Spain and
enter the gambling-room. He stepped in front
of her. She looked up, furious. &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221; she exclaimed with indignation. &#8220;Let
me pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of her voice restored his self-possession.
He made no move to get out of her way,
indeed he rather pointedly continued to obstruct
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
her. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made a mistake, I think,&#8221; he said
evenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not,&#8221; she replied with resentment.
&#8220;Let me pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you have. You don&#8217;t know where you
are going,&#8221; he persisted, his eyes bent uncompromisingly
on hers.</p>
<p>She showed increasing irritation at his attempt
to exculpate her. &#8220;I know perfectly well where
I am going,&#8221; she retorted with heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know,&#8221; he returned steadily, &#8220;that
you&#8217;ve no business to enter such a place.&#8221;</p>
<p>His opposition seemed only to anger her. &#8220;I
know where I have business. I need no admonitions
from you as to what places I enter. You
are impertinent, insulting. Let me pass!&#8221;</p>
<p>His stubborn opposition showed no signs of
weakening before her resolve. &#8220;One question,&#8221;
he said, ignoring her angry words. &#8220;Have you
ever been in these rooms before?&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought she quailed the least bit before his
searching look. She even hesitated as to what
to say. But if her eyes fell momentarily it was
only to collect herself. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered,
looking up unflinchingly.</p>
<p>Her resolute eyes supported her defiant word
and openly challenged his interference, but he
met her once more quietly. &#8220;I am sorry to hear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
it,&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;But that won&#8217;t make any
difference. You can&#8217;t go in to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go in,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he returned slowly, &#8220;you are not going
in&ndash;&ndash;not, at least, while I am here.&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood immovable. He tried to reason
her out of her determination. She resented
every word he offered. &#8220;You are most insolent,&#8221;
she exclaimed. &#8220;You are interfering in something
that is no concern of yours. You have no
right to act in this outrageous way. If you don&#8217;t
stand aside I&#8217;ll call for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan!&#8221; De Spain spoke her name suddenly
and threateningly. His words fell fast, and he
checked her for an instant with his vehemence.
&#8220;We met in the Gap a week ago. I said I was
telling you the exact truth. Did I do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you said or what you
did&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Answer me,&#8221; he said sharply, &#8220;did I tell you
the truth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know or care&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you do know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you say or do&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you the truth then, I am telling it now.
I will never see you enter a gambling-room as long
as I can prevent it. Call for help if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with amazement. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
seemed about to speak&ndash;&ndash;to make another protest.
Instead, she turned suddenly away, hesitated
again, put both her hands to her face,
burst into tears, and hurried toward the stairs.
De Spain followed her. &#8220;Let me take you to
where you are going?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan turned on him, her eyes blazing through
her tears, with a single, scornful, furious word:
&#8220;No!&#8221; She quickened her step from him in such
confusion that she ran into two men just reaching
the top of the stairs. They separated with
alacrity, and gave her passage. One of the men
was Lefever, who, despite his size, was extremely
nimble in getting out of her urgent way, and
quick in lifting his hat. She fairly raced down
the flight of steps, leaving Lefever looking after
her in astonishment. He turned to de Spain:
&#8220;Now, who the deuce was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain ignored his question by asking another:
&#8220;Did you find him?&#8221; Lefever shook his
head. &#8220;Not a trace; I covered Main Street.
I guess Bob was right. Nobody home here,
Henry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody we want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing. If you will wait here for Bob,
I&#8217;ll run over to the office and answer those telegrams.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>De Spain started for the stairs. &#8220;Henry,&#8221;
called Lefever, as his companion trotted hastily
down, &#8220;if you catch up to her, kindly apologize
for a fat man.&#8221;</p>
<p>But de Spain was balked of an opportunity to
follow Nan. In the street he ran into Scott.
&#8220;Did you get the story?&#8221; demanded de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it Sassoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott shook his head. &#8220;I wish it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Deaf Sandusky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Calabasas?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott nodded. &#8220;You must have moved a
couple of inches at the right nick, Henry. That
man Sandusky,&#8221; Bob smiled a sickly smile,
&#8220;doesn&#8217;t miss very often. He was bothered a
little by his friends being all around you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two regarded each other for a moment in
silence. &#8220;Why,&#8221; asked de Spain, boiling a little,
&#8220;should that damned, hulking brute try to blow
<i>my</i> head off just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only for the good of the order, Henry,&#8221;
grinned the scout.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice job Jeff has picked out for me,&#8221; muttered
de Spain grimly, &#8220;standing up in these
Sleepy Cat barrooms to be shot at.&#8221; He drew
in a good breath and threw up the wet brim of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
hat. &#8220;Well, such is life in the high country, I
suppose. Some fine day Mr. Sandusky will manage
to get me&ndash;&ndash;or I&#8217;ll manage to get him&ndash;&ndash;that
all depends on how the happening happens.
Anyway, Bob, it&#8217;s bad luck to miss a man. We&#8217;ll
hang that much of a handicap on his beef-eating
crop. Is he the fellow John calls the butcher?&#8221;
demanded de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what everybody calls him, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two rejoined Lefever at the head of the
stairs and the three discussed the news. Even
Lefever seemed more serious when he heard the
report. Scott, when asked where Sandusky now
was, nodded toward the big room in front of them.</p>
<p>Lefever looked toward the gambling-tables.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll go in and look at him.&#8221; He turned to
Scott to invite his comment on the proposal.
&#8220;Think twice, John,&#8221; suggested the Indian. &#8220;If
there&#8217;s any trouble in a crowd like that, somebody
that has no interest in de Spain or Sandusky is
pretty sure to get hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to start anything,&#8221; explained
Lefever. &#8220;I only want de Spain to look at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But sometimes things start themselves. Lefever
found Sandusky at a faro-table. At his side
sat his partner, Logan. Three other players, together
with the onlookers, and the dealer&ndash;&ndash;whose
tumbled hair fell partly over the visor that protected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
his eyes from the glare of the overhead
light&ndash;&ndash;made up the group. The table stood next
to that of Tenison, who, white-faced and impassive
under the heat and light, still held to his chair.</p>
<p>Lefever took a position at one end of the table,
where he faced Sandusky, and de Spain, just behind
his shoulder, had a chance to look the two
Calabasas men closely over. Sandusky again impressed
him as a powerful man, who, beyond an
ample stomach, carried his weight without showing
it. What de Spain most noted, as it lay on
the table, was the size and extreme length of the
outlaw&#8217;s hand. He had heard of Sandusky&#8217;s
hand. From the tips of the big fingers to the
base of the palm, this right hand, spread over his
chips, would cover half again the length of the
hand of the average man.</p>
<p>De Spain credited readily the extraordinary
stories he had heard of Sandusky&#8217;s dexterity with
a revolver or a rifle. That he should so lately
have missed a shot at so close range was partly
explained now that de Spain perceived Sandusky&#8217;s
small, hard, brown eyes were somewhat unnaturally
bright, and that his brows knit every little
while in his effort to collect himself. But his
stimulation only partly explained the failure; it
was notoriously hard to upset the powerful outlaw
with alcohol. De Spain noted the coarse,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
straw-colored hair&ndash;&ndash;plastered recently over the
forehead by a barber&ndash;&ndash;the heavy, sandy mustache,
freshly waxed by the same hand, the bellicose
nostrils of the Roman nose, the broad, split
chin, and mean, deep lines of a most unpromising
face. Sandusky&#8217;s brown shirt sprawled open at
the collar, and de Spain remembered again the
flashy waistcoat, fastened at the last buttonhole
by a cut-glass button.</p>
<p>At Sandusky&#8217;s side sat his crony in all important
undertakings&ndash;&ndash;a much smaller, sparer
man, with aggressive shoulders and restless eyes.
Logan was the lookout of the pair, and his roving
glance lighted on de Spain before the latter had
inspected him more than a moment. He lost no
time in beginning on de Spain with an insolent
question as to what he was looking at. De Spain,
his eye bent steadily on him, answered with a
tone neither of apology nor pronounced offense:
&#8220;I am looking at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever hitched at his trousers cheerily and,
stepping away from de Spain, took a position
just behind the dealer. &#8220;What are you looking
at me for?&#8221; demanded Logan insolently.</p>
<p>De Spain raised his voice to match exactly the
tone of the inquiry. &#8220;So I&#8217;ll know you next
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Logan pushed back his chair. As he turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
his legs from under the table to rise, a hand
rested on his shoulder. He looked up and saw
the brown face and feeble smile of Scott. Logan
with his nearest foot kicked Sandusky. The big
fellow looked up and around. Either by chance
or in following the sound of the last voice, his
glance fell on de Spain. He scrutinized for a
suspicious instant the burning eyes and the red
mark low on the cheek. While he did so&ndash;&ndash;comprehension
dawning on him&ndash;&ndash;his enormous hands,
forsaking the pile of chips with which both had
been for a moment busy, flattened out, palms
down, on the faro-table. Logan tried to rise.
Scott&#8217;s hand rested heavily on him. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the row?&#8221; demanded Sandusky in the queer tone
of a deaf man. Logan pointed at de Spain.
&#8220;That Medicine Bend duck wants a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a man, Logan; not with a cub,&#8221; retorted
de Spain, matching insult with insult.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I can do something for you,&#8221; interposed
Sandusky. His eyes ran like a flash around
the table. He saw how Lefever had pre-empted
the best place in the room. He looked up and
back at the man standing now at his shoulder,
and almost between Logan and himself. It was
the Indian, Scott. Sandusky felt, as his faculties
cleared and arranged themselves every instant,
that there was no hurry whatever about lifting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
his hand; but he could not be faced down without
a show of resistance, and he concluded that for
this occasion his tongue was the best weapon.
&#8220;If I can,&#8221; he added stiffly, &#8220;I&#8217;m at your service.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain made no answer beyond keeping his
eyes well on Sandusky&#8217;s eyes. Tenison, overhearing
the last words, awoke to the situation
and rose from his case. He made his way through
the crowd around the disputants and brusquely
directed the dealer to close the game. While
Sandusky was cashing in, Tenison took Logan
aside. What Tenison said was not audible, but it
sufficed to quiet the little fellow. The only thing
further to be settled was as to who should leave
the room last, since neither party was willing to
go first. Tenison, after a formal conference with
Lefever and Logan, offered to take Sandusky
and Logan by a private stairway to the billiard-room,
while Lefever took de Spain and Scott out
by way of the main entrance. This was arranged,
and when the railroad men reached the
street rain had ceased falling.</p>
<p>Scott warned de Spain to keep within doors,
and de Spain promised to do so. But when they
left him he started out at once to see whether he
could not, by some happy chance, encounter Nan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>A CUP OF COFFEE</h3>
</div>
<p>He was willing, after a long and bootless
search, to confess to himself that he would
rather see Nan Morgan for one minute than all
women else in the world for a lifetime. The other
incidents of the evening would have given any
ordinary man enough food for reflection&ndash;&ndash;indeed
they did force de Spain to realize that his life
would hang by a slender thread while he remained
at Sleepy Cat and continued to brave the rulers
of the Sinks.</p>
<p>But this danger, which after all was a portion
of his responsibility in freeing his stages from
the depredations of the Calabasas gang, failed to
make on him the moving impression of one moment
of Nan Morgan&#8217;s eyes. She could upset
him completely, he was forced to admit, by a
glance, a word, a gesture&ndash;&ndash;a mere turn of her
head. There was in the whole world nothing he
wanted to do so much as in some way to please
her&ndash;&ndash;yet it seemed his ill luck to get continually
deeper into her bad graces. It had so stunned
and angered him to meet her intent on entering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
a gambling-hall that he was tormented the whole
night. Association with outlaws&ndash;&ndash;what might it
not do for even such a girl? While her people
were not all equally reprobate, some of them at
least were not far better than the criminals of
Calabasas. To conceive of her gambling publicly
in Sleepy Cat was too much. He had even
taken a horse, after cautiously but persistently
haunting the streets for an hour, and ridden across
the river away out on the mountain trail, hoping
to catch a sight of her.</p>
<p>On his way back to town from this wild-goose
chase, he heard the sound of hoofs. He was
nearing the river and he turned his horse into a
clump of trees beside the bridge. The night was
very dark, but he was close to the trail and had
made up his mind to speak to Nan if it were she.
In another moment his ear told him there were
two horses approaching. He waited for the
couple to cross the bridge, and they passed him
so close he could almost have touched the nearer
rider. Then he realized, as the horse passing beside
him shied, that it was Sandusky and Logan
riding silently by.</p>
<p>For a week de Spain spent most of his time in
Sleepy Cat trying to catch sight of Nan. His
reflection on the untoward incidents that had set
them at variance left him rebellious. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
meditated more about putting himself right with her
than about all his remaining concerns together.
A strange fire had seized him&ndash;&ndash;that fire of the
imagination which scorns fair words and fine reasoning,
but which, smothered, burns in secret until,
fanned by the wind of accident, it bursts out
the more fiercely because of the depths in which
it has smouldered.</p>
<p>Every day that de Spain rode across the open
country, his eyes turned to the far range and to
Music Mountain. The rounded, distant, immutable
peak&ndash;&ndash;majestic as the sun, cold as the
stars, shrouding in its unknown fastnesses the
mysteries of the ages and the secrets of time&ndash;&ndash;meant
to him now only this mountain girl whom
its solitude sheltered and to whom his thoughts
continually came back.</p>
<p>Within two weeks he became desperate. He
rode the Gap trail from Sleepy Cat again and again
for miles and miles in the effort to encounter her.
He came to know every ridge and hollow on it,
every patch and stone between the lava beds and
the Rat River. And in spite of the counsels of
his associates, who warned him to beware of
traps, he spent, under one pretext or another,
much of the time either on the stages to and
from Calabasas or in the saddle toward Morgan&#8217;s
Gap, looking for Nan.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>Killing time in this way, after a fruitless ride,
his persistence was one day most unexpectedly
rewarded at the Calabasas barns. He had ridden
through a hot sun from Sleepy Cat, passing the
up stage half-way to Calabasas, and had struck
from there directly out on the Sinks toward Morgan&#8217;s
Gap. Riding thence around the lower
lava beds, he had headed for Calabasas, where he
had an appointment to meet Scott and Lefever
at five o&#8217;clock. When de Spain reached the
Calabasas barn, McAlpin, the barn boss, was
standing in the doorway. &#8220;You&#8217;d never be comin&#8217;
from Sleepy Cat in the saddle!&#8221; exclaimed McAlpin
incredulously. De Spain nodded affirmatively
as he dismounted. &#8220;Hot ride, sir; a hot
day,&#8221; commented McAlpin, shaking his head
dubiously as he called a man to take the horse,
unstrapped de Spain&#8217;s coat from the saddle, and
followed the manager into the office.</p>
<p>The heat was oppressive, and de Spain unbuckled
his cartridge-belt, slipped his revolver
from the holster, mechanically stuck it inside his
trousers waistband, hung the heavy belt up under
his coat, and, sitting down, called for the
stage report and asked whether the new blacksmith
had sobered up. When McAlpin had given
him all minor information called for, de Spain
walked with him out into the barn to inspect the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
horses. Passing the very last of the box-stalls,
the manager saw in it a pony. He stopped. No
second glance was needed to tell him it was a
good horse; then he realized that this wiry, sleek-legged
roan, contentedly munching at the moment
some company hay, was Nan Morgan&#8217;s.</p>
<p>McAlpin, talking volubly, essayed to move on,
but de Spain, stubbornly pausing, only continued
to look at the handsome saddle-horse. McAlpin
saw he was in for it, and resigned himself to an
inquisition. When de Spain asked whose horse
it was, McAlpin was ready. &#8220;That little pony
is Nan Morgan&#8217;s, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain made no comment. &#8220;Good-looking
pony, sir,&#8221; ventured McAlpin half-heartedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it doing here?&#8221; demanded de Spain
coldly.</p>
<p>Before answering, the barn boss eyed de Spain
very carefully to see how the wind was setting,
for the pony&#8217;s presence confessed an infraction
of a very particular rule. &#8220;You see,&#8221; he began,
cocking at his strict boss from below his visorless
cap a questioning Scotch eye, &#8220;I like to keep on
good terms with that gang. Some of them can
be very ugly. It&#8217;s better to be friends with them
when you can&ndash;&ndash;by stretching the barn rules a
little once in a while&ndash;&ndash;than to have enemies of
&#8217;em all the time&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you think so, sir?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s her horse doing here?&#8221; asked de
Spain, without commenting on the long story,
but also without showing, as far as the barnman
could detect, any growing resentment at the infraction
of his regulations.</p>
<p>McAlpin made even the most inconsequential
approaches to a statement with a keen and questioning
glance. &#8220;The girl went up to the Cat
on the early stage, sir. She&#8217;s coming back this
afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is she riding away over here to Calabasas
for to take the stage, instead of riding
straight into Sleepy Cat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Once more McAlpin eyed him carefully. &#8220;The
girl&#8217;s been sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t really fit to ride a step,&#8221; confided
the Scotch boss with growing confidence. &#8220;But
she&#8217;s been going up two or three times now to
get some medicine from Doc Torpy&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s the
way of it. There&#8217;s a nice girl, sir&ndash;&ndash;in a bunch
o&#8217; ruffians, I know&ndash;&ndash;though old Duke, she lives
with, he ain&#8217;t a half-bad man except for too many
cards; I used to work for him&ndash;&ndash;but I call her a
nice girl. Do you happen to know her?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain had long been on guard. &#8220;I&#8217;ve spoken
with her in a business way one or twice, Jim.
I can&#8217;t really say I know her.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Nice girl. But that&#8217;s a tough bunch in that
Gap, sure as you&#8217;re alive; yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain was well aware the canny boss ought
to know. McAlpin had lived at one time in the
Gap, and was himself reputed to have been a
hardy and enduring rider on a night round-up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything sick, Jim?&#8221; asked de Spain, walking
on down the barn and looking at the horses. It
was only the second time since he had given him
the job that de Spain had called the barn boss
&#8220;Jim,&#8221; and McAlpin answered with the rising
assurance of one who realizes he is &#8220;in&#8221; right.
&#8220;Not so much as a sore hoof in either alley, Mr.
de Spain. I try to take care of them, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we paying you, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-seven a week, sir; pretty heavy work
at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try to make that thirty-two after this
week.&#8221;</p>
<p>McAlpin touched his cap. &#8220;Thank you kindly,
sir, I&#8217;m sure. It costs like hell to live out here,
Mr. de Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lefever says you live off him at poker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! Ha, ha, sir! John will have his
joke. He&#8217;s always after me to play poker with
him&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t like to do it. I&#8217;ve got a family to
support&ndash;&ndash;he ain&#8217;t. But by and far, I don&#8217;t think
John and me is ten dollars apart, year in and year
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
out. Look at that bay, sir! A month ago Elpaso
said that horse was all in&ndash;&ndash;look at him now.
I manage to keep things up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say,&#8221; asked de Spain indifferently,
&#8220;had been the matter with Nan Morgan?&#8221;
Her name seemed a whole mouthful to speak, so
fearful was he of betraying interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I really didn&#8217;t say, sir. And I don&#8217;t
know. But from what she says, and the way she
coughs, I&#8217;m thinking it was a touch of this p-new-monia
that&#8217;s going around so much lately, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>His listener recalled swiftly the days that had
passed since the night he had seen her wet through
in the cold rain at Sleepy Cat. He feared Jim&#8217;s
diagnosis might be right. And he had already
made all arrangements to meet the occasion now
presenting itself. Circumstances seemed at last
to favor him, and he looked at his watch. The
down stage bringing Nan back would be due in
less than an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; he said thoughtfully, &#8220;you are doing
the right thing in showing some good-will toward
the Morgans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m glad you think that, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I unintentionally rubbed their
backs the wrong way in dragging Sassoon out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re jealous of their power, I know&ndash;&ndash;very
jealous.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&#8220;This seems the chance to show that I have no
real animosity myself toward the outfit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since de Spain was not looking at him, McAlpin
cocked two keen and curious eyes on the sphinx-like
birthmark of the very amiable speaker&#8217;s face.
However, the astute boss, if he wondered, made
no comment. &#8220;When the stage comes in,&#8221; continued
de Spain quietly, &#8220;have the two grays&ndash;&ndash;Lady
and Ben&ndash;&ndash;hitched to my own light Studebaker.
I&#8217;ll drive her over to the Gap myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The very thing,&#8221; exclaimed McAlpin, staring
and struggling with his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some way I&#8217;ve happened, both times I
talked with her, to get in wrong&ndash;&ndash;understand?&#8221;
McAlpin, with clearing wits, nodded more than
once. &#8220;No fault of mine; it just happened so.
And she may not at first take kindly to the idea
of going with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she ought to do it. She will be tired&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
a long, dusty ride for a well woman, let alone
one that has been ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it is, so it is!&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain looked now shamelessly at his ready-witted
aid. &#8220;See that her pony is lame when she
gets here&ndash;&ndash;can&#8217;t be ridden. But you&#8217;ll take good
care of him and send him home in a few days&ndash;&ndash;get
it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>McAlpin half closed his eyes. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be so
lame it would stagger a cowboy to back him ten
feet&ndash;&ndash;and never be hurt a mite, neither. Trust
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No other horse that she could ride, in the
barn?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No horse she could ride between Calabasas
and Thief River.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she insists on riding <i>something</i>, or even
walking home,&#8221; continued de Spain dubiously,
for he felt instinctively that he should have the
task of his life to induce Nan to accept any kind
of a peace-offering, &#8220;I&#8217;ll ride or walk with her
anyway. Can you sleep me here to-night, on the
hay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep you on a hair mattress, sir. You&#8217;ve
got a room right here up-stairs, didn&#8217;t you know
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind the bed,&#8221; directed de Spain prudently.
&#8220;I like the hay better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As you like; we&#8217;ve got plenty of it fresh up-stairs,
from the Gap. But the bed&#8217;s all right,
sir; it is, on me word.&#8221;</p>
<p>With arrangements so begun, de Spain walked
out-of-doors and looked reflectively up the Sleepy
Cat road. One further refinement in his appeal
for Nan&#8217;s favor suggested itself. She would be
hungry, possibly faint in the heat and dust, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
she arrived. He returned to McAlpin: &#8220;Where
can I get a good cup of coffee when the stage
comes in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go right down to the inn, sir. It&#8217;s a new
chap running it&ndash;&ndash;a half-witted man from Texas.
My wife is cooking there off and on. She&#8217;ll fix
you up a sandwich and a cup of good coffee.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was four o&#8217;clock, and the sun beat fiercely
on the desert. De Spain walked down to the inn
unmindful of the heat. In summer rig, with his
soft-shirt collar turned under, his forearms bare,
and his thoughts engaged, he made his way rapidly
on, looking neither to the right nor the left.</p>
<p>As he approached the weather-beaten pile
it looked no more inviting in sunshine than it
had looked in shadow; and true to its traditions,
not a living being was anywhere to be seen. The
door of the office stood ajar. De Spain, pushing
it all the way open, walked in. No one greeted
him as he crossed the threshold, and the unsightly
room was still bare of furnishings except for the
great mahogany bar, with its two very large
broken mirrors and the battered pilasters and
carvings.</p>
<p>De Spain pounded on the bar. His effort to
attract attention met with no response. He
walked to the left end of the bar, lifted the hand-rail
that enclosed the space behind it, and pushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
open the door between the mirrors leading to
the back room. This, too, was empty. He
called out&ndash;&ndash;there was no response. He walked
through a second door opening on an arcaded
passageway toward the kitchen&ndash;&ndash;not a soul was
in sight. There was a low fire in the kitchen
stove, but Mrs. McAlpin had apparently gone
home for a while. Walking back toward the
office, he remembered the covered way leading
to a patio, which in turn opened on the main
road. He perceived also that at the end next
the office the covered way faced the window at
the end of the long bar.</p>
<p>Irritated at the desertion of the place, due, he
afterward learned, to the heat of the afternoon,
and disappointed at the frustration of his purpose,
he walked back through the rear room into
the office. As he lifted the hand-rail and, passing
through, lowered it behind him, he took out his
watch to see how soon the stage was due. While
he held the timepiece in his hand he heard a
rapid clatter of hoofs approaching the place.
Thinking it might be Scott and Lefever arriving
from the south an hour ahead of time, he started
toward the front door&ndash;&ndash;which was still open&ndash;&ndash;to
greet them. Outside, hurried footsteps reached
the door just ahead of him and a large man, stepping
quickly into the room, confronted de Spain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
One of the man&#8217;s hands rested lightly on his right
side. De Spain recognized him instantly; the
small, drooping head, carried well forward, the
keen eyes, the long hand, and, had there still
been a question in his mind, the loud-patterned,
shabby waistcoat would have proclaimed beyond
doubt&ndash;&ndash;Deaf Sandusky.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE GLASS BUTTON</h3>
</div>
<p>Even as the big fellow stepped lightly just
inside and to the left&ndash;&ndash;as de Spain stood&ndash;&ndash;of
the door and faced him, the encounter seemed
to de Spain accidental. While Sandusky was not
a man he would have chosen to meet at that time,
he did not at first consider the incident an eventful
one. But before he could speak, a second
man appeared in the doorway, and this man appeared
to be joking with a third, behind him.
As the second man crossed the threshold, de Spain
saw Sandusky&#8217;s high-voiced little fighting crony,
Logan, who now made way, as he stepped within
to the right of the open door, for the swinging
shoulders and rolling stride of Gale Morgan.</p>
<p>Morgan, eying de Spain with insolence, as was
his wont, closed the door behind him with a
bang. Then he backed his powerful frame significantly
against it.</p>
<p>A blind man could have seen the completeness
of the snare. An unpleasant feeling flashed
across de Spain&#8217;s perception. It was only for the
immeasurable part of a second&ndash;&ndash;while uncertainty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
was resolving itself into a rapid certainty. When
Gale Morgan stepped into the room on the heels
of his two Calabasas friends, de Spain would
have sold for less than a cup of coffee all his
chances for life. Nevertheless, before Morgan
had set his back fairly against the door and the
trap was sprung, de Spain had mapped his fight,
and had already felt that, although he might not
be the fortunate man, not more than one of the
four within the room would be likely to leave it
alive.</p>
<p>He did not retreat from where he halted at the
instant Sandusky entered. His one slender chance
was to hug to the men that meant to kill him.
Morgan, the nearest, he esteemed the least dangerous
of the three; but to think to escape both
Sandusky and Logan at close quarters was, he
knew, more than ought to be hoped for.</p>
<p>While Morgan was closing the door, de Spain
smiled at his visitors: &#8220;That isn&#8217;t necessary,
Morgan: I&#8217;m not ready to run.&#8221; Morgan only
continued to stare at him. &#8220;I need hardly ask,&#8221;
added de Spain, &#8220;whether you fellows have business
with me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked to Sandusky for a reply; it was Logan
who answered in shrill falsetto: &#8220;No. We
don&#8217;t happen to have business that I know of. A
friend of ours may have a little, maybe!&#8221; Logan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
lifting his shoulders with his laugh, looked toward
his companions for an answer to his joke.</p>
<p>De Spain&#8217;s smile appeared unruffled: &#8220;You&#8217;ll
help him transact it, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Logan, looking again toward Sandusky, grinned:
&#8220;He won&#8217;t need any help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is your friend?&#8221; demanded de Spain
good-naturedly. Logan&#8217;s glance misled him; it
did not refer to Sandusky. And even as he asked
the question de Spain heard through the half-open
window at the end of the bar the sound of hoofs.
Hoping against hope for Lefever, the interruption
cheered him. It certainly did not seem that
his situation could be made worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; answered Logan, talking again to his
gallery of cronies, &#8220;we&#8217;ve got two or three friends
that want to see you. They&#8217;re waiting outside
to see what you&#8217;ll look like in about five minutes&ndash;&ndash;ain&#8217;t
they, Gale?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some one was moving within the rear room.
De Spain felt hope in every footfall he heard, and
the mention this time of Morgan&#8217;s name cleared
his plan of battle. Before Gale, with an oath,
could blurt out his answer, de Spain had resolved
to fight where he stood, taking Logan first and
Morgan as he should jump in between the two.
It was at the best a hopeless venture against Sandusky&#8217;s
first shot, which de Spain knew was almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
sure to reach a vital spot. But desperate
men cannot be choosers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no time for seeing me like the present,&#8221;
declared de Spain, ignoring Morgan and addressing
his words to Logan. &#8220;Bring your
friends in. What are you complaining about,
Morgan?&#8221; he asked, resenting the stream of abuse
that Gale hurled at him whenever he could get a
word in. &#8220;I had my turn at you with a rifle the
other day. You&#8217;ve got your turn now. And I
call it a pretty soft one, too&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t you, Sandusky?&#8221;
he demanded suddenly of the big fellow.</p>
<p>Sandusky alone through the talk had kept an
unbroken silence. He was eating up de Spain
with his eyes, and de Spain not only ached to
hear him speak but was resolved to make him.
Sandusky had stood motionless from the instant
he entered the room. He knew all about the preliminary
gabble of a fight and took no interest in
it. He did <i>not</i> know all about de Spain, and being
about to face his bullets he had prudence enough
to wonder whether the man could have brought
a reputation to Sleepy Cat without having done
something to earn it. What Sandusky was sensibly
intent on was the determination that he
should not contribute personally to the further
upbuilding of anybody&#8217;s reputation. His eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
with this resolve shining in them rested intently
on de Spain, and at his side the long fingers
of his right hand beat a soft tattoo against his
pistol holster. De Spain&#8217;s question seemed to
arouse him. &#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; he demanded
bluntly. His voice was heavy and his deafness
was reflected in the strained tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on the butt of my gun, Sandusky.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that he says?&#8221; demanded the man
known as the butcher, asking the question of
Logan, but without taking his eyes off his shifty
prey.</p>
<p>Logan raised his voice to repeat the words and
to add a ribald comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You make a good deal of noise,&#8221; muttered
Sandusky, speaking again to de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ought not to bother you much, Sandusky,&#8221;
shouted de Spain, trying to win a smile
from his taciturn antagonist.</p>
<p>&#8220;His noise won&#8217;t bother anybody much longer,&#8221;
put in Logan, whose retorts overflowed at every
interval. But there was no smile even hinted at
in the uncompromising vigilance of Sandusky&#8217;s
expressionless face. De Spain discounted the next
few minutes far enough to feel that Sandusky&#8217;s
first shot would mean death to him, even if he
could return it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you, de Spain,&#8221; continued Logan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
&#8220;we&#8217;re going to have a drink with you. Then
we&#8217;re going to prepare you for going back where
you come from&ndash;&ndash;with nice flowers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you thought you could come out here
and run over everybody in the Spanish Sinks,&#8221;
interposed Morgan, with every oath he could
summon to load his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep out, Morgan,&#8221; exclaimed Logan testily.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do this talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain continued to banter. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221;
he said, addressing the three together and realizing
that every moment wasted before the shooting
added a grain of hope, &#8220;I am ready to drink when
you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s ready to drink, Tom,&#8221; roared Morgan
in the deaf man&#8217;s ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; announced Sandusky in hollow
voice.</p>
<p>Still regarding de Spain with the most businesslike
expression, the grizzled outlaw took a
guarded step forward, his companions following
suit. De Spain, always with a jealous regard for
the relative distance between him and his self-appointed
executioners, moved backward. In
crossing the room, Sandusky, without objection
from his companions, moved across their front,
and when the four lined up at the bar their positions
had changed. De Spain stood at the extreme
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
left, Sandusky next, Logan beside him,
and Gale Morgan, at the other end of the line,
pretended to pound the bar for service. De Spain,
following mountain etiquette in the circumstances,
spread his open hands, palms down,
on the bar. Sandusky&#8217;s great palms slid in the
same fashion over the checked slab in unspoken
recognition of the brief armistice. Logan&#8217;s hands
came up in turn, and Morgan still pounded for
some one to serve.</p>
<p>De Spain in the new disposition weighed his
chances as being both better and worse. They
had put Sandusky&#8217;s first shot at no more than an
arm&#8217;s length from his prey, with Logan next to
cover the possibility of the big fellow&#8217;s failing to
paralyze de Spain the first instant. On the other
hand, de Spain, trained in the tactics of Whispering
Smith and Medicine Bend gunmen, welcomed
a short-arm struggle with the worst of his assailants
closest at hand. One factor, too, that he
realized they were reckoning with, gave him no
concern. No men in the mountains understood
better or were more expert in the technicalities
of the law of self-defense than the gunmen of
Calabasas. The killing of de Spain they well
knew would, in spite of everything, raise a hornet&#8217;s
nest in Sleepy Cat, and they wished to be
prepared for it. Their man&oelig;uvring on this score
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
caused no disquiet to their slender, compactly
built victim. &#8220;You&#8217;ll wait a long time, if you
wait for service here, Morgan,&#8221; he said, commenting
with composure on Morgan&#8217;s impatience.
Logan looked again at his two companions and
laughed.</p>
<p>Every hope de Spain had of possible help from
the back room died with that laugh. Then the
door behind the bar slowly opened, and the scar-featured
face of Sassoon peered cautiously from
the gloom. The horse thief, stooping, walked in
with a leer directed triumphantly at the railroad
man.</p>
<p>If it were possible to deepen it, the sinister spot
on de Spain&#8217;s face darkened. Something in his
blood raged at the sight of the malevolent face.
He glanced at Logan. &#8220;This,&#8221; he smiled faintly,
nodding toward Sassoon as he himself took a
short step farther to the left, &#8220;is your drink,
Harvey, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; retorted Logan loudly, &#8220;this is <i>your</i>
drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take Sassoon,&#8221; assented de Spain, good-natured
again and shifting still another step to
the left. &#8220;What do you fellows want now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to punch a hole through that strawberry,&#8221;
said Logan, &#8220;that beauty-mark. Where
did you get it, de Spain?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I might as well ask where you get your gall,
Harvey,&#8221; returned de Spain, watching Logan
hunch Sandusky toward the left that both might
crowd him closer. &#8220;I was born with my beauty-mark&ndash;&ndash;just
as you were born with your damned
bad manners,&#8221; he added composedly, for in hugging
up to him his enemies were playing his game.
&#8220;You can&#8217;t help it, neither can I,&#8221; he went on.
&#8220;Somebody is bound to pay for putting that
mark on me. Somebody is bound to pay for your
manners. Why talk about either? Sassoon, set
out for your friends&ndash;&ndash;or I will. Spread, gentlemen,
spread.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had reached the position on which he believed
his life depended, and stood so close to
the end of the bar that with a single step, as he
uttered the last words, he turned it. Sandusky
pushed close next him. De Spain continued to
speak without hesitation or break, but the words
seemed to have no place in his mind. He was
thinking only, and saw only within his field of
vision, a cut-glass button that fastened the bottom
of Sandusky&#8217;s greased waistcoat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve waited one day too long to collect for
your strawberry, de Spain,&#8221; cried Logan shrilly.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve turned one trick too many on the Sinks,
young fellow. If the man that put your mark
on you ain&#8217;t in this room, you&#8217;ll never get him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Which means, I take it, you&#8217;re going to try
to get me,&#8221; smiled de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; bellowed Morgan, &#8220;it means we have
got you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are fooling yourself, Harvey.&#8221; De Spain
addressed the warning to Logan. &#8220;And you, too,
Sandusky,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take care of that,&#8221; grinned Logan.
Sandusky kept silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are jumping into another man&#8217;s fight,&#8221;
protested de Spain steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sassoon&#8217;s fight is our fight,&#8221; interrupted Morgan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I advise you,&#8221; said de Spain once more, looking
with the words at Sandusky and his crony,
&#8220;to keep out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandusky,&#8221; yelled Logan to his partner, &#8220;he
advises me and you to keep out of this fight,&#8221;
he shrilly laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; assented Sandusky, but with no variation
in tone and his eyes on de Spain.</p>
<p>Logan, with an oath, leaned over the bar toward
Sassoon, and pointed contemptuously toward the
end of the bar. &#8220;Shike!&#8221; he cried, &#8220;step through
the rail and take that man&#8217;s gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain, looking from one to the other of the
four faces confronting him, laughed for the first
time. But he was looking without seeing what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
he seemed to look at. In reality, he saw only a
cut-glass button. He was face to face with taking
a man&#8217;s life or surrendering his own, and he knew
the life must be taken in such a way as instantly
to disable its possessor. These men had chosen
their time and place. There was nothing for it
but to meet them. Sassoon was stepping toward
him, though very doubtfully. De Spain laughed
again, dryly this time. &#8220;Go slow, Sassoon,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;That gun is loaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want terms, hand over your gun to
Sassoon,&#8221; cried Logan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till it&#8217;s empty,&#8221; returned de Spain. &#8220;Do
you want to try taking it?&#8221; he demanded of Logan,
his cheeks burning a little darker.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>

<p class='caption'>
Hugging his shield, de Spain threw his second shot over Sandusky&#8217;s left shoulder.<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Logan never answered the question. It was
not meant to be answered. For de Spain asked it
only to cover the spring he made at that instant
into Sandusky&#8217;s middle. Catlike though it was,
the feint did not take the big fellow unprepared.
He had heard once, when or where he could not
tell, but he had never forgotten the hint, that de
Spain, a boxer, was as quick with his feet as with
his hands. The outlaw whirled. Both men shot
from the hip; the reports cracked together. One
bullet grazing the fancy button smashed through
the gaudy waistcoat: the other, as de Spain&#8217;s
free hand struck at the muzzle of the big man&#8217;s
gun, tore into de Spain&#8217;s foot. Sandusky, convulsed
by the frightful shock, staggered against
de Spain&#8217;s arm, the latter dancing tight against
him. Logan, alive to the trick but caught behind
his partner, fired over Sandusky&#8217;s right shoulder
at de Spain&#8217;s head, flattened sidewise against the
gasping outlaw&#8217;s breast. Hugging his shield, de
Spain threw his second shot over Sandusky&#8217;s left
shoulder into Logan&#8217;s face. Logan, sinking to the
floor, never moved again. Supporting with extraordinary
strength the unwieldy bulk of the
dying butcher, de Spain managed to steady him
as a buffer against Morgan&#8217;s fire until he could
send a slug over Sandusky&#8217;s head at the instant
the latter collapsed. Morgan fell against the bar.</p>
<p>Sandusky&#8217;s weight dragged de Spain down. For
an instant the four men sprawled in a heap. Sassoon,
who had not yet got an effective shot across
at his agile enemy, dropping his revolver, dodged
under the rail to close. De Spain, struggling to
free himself from the dying man, saw, through a
mist, the greenish eyes and the thirsty knife. He
fired from the floor. The bullet shook without
stopping his enemy, and de Spain, partly caught
under Sandusky&#8217;s body, thought, as Sassoon came
on, the game was up. With an effort born of
desperation, he dragged himself from under the
twitching giant, freed his revolver, rolled away,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
and, with his sight swimming, swung the gun at
Sassoon&#8217;s stomach. He meant to kill him. The
bullet whirled the white-faced man to one side
and he dropped, but pulled himself, full of fight,
to his knees and, knife in hand, panted forward.
De Spain rolling hastily from him, staggered to
his feet and, running in as Sassoon tried to strike,
beat him senseless with the butt of his gun.</p>
<p>His own eyes were streaming blood. His head
was reeling and he was breathless, but he remembered
those of the gang waiting outside. He still
could see dimly the window at the end of the bar.
Dashing his fingers through the red stream on
his forehead, he ran for the window, smashed
through the sash into the patio and found Sassoon&#8217;s
horse trembling at the fusillade. Catching
the lines and the pommel, he stuck his foot up
again and again for the stirrup. It was useless;
he could not make it. Then, summoning all of
his fast-ebbing strength, he threw himself like a
sack across the horse&#8217;s back, lashed the brute
through the open gateway, climbed into the saddle,
and spurred blindly away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>AFTER THE STORM</h3>
</div>
<p>It was well along toward midnight of the same
day when two horsemen, after having ridden
circumspectly around the outbuildings and corrals,
dismounted from their horses at some little
distance from the door of the Calabasas Inn.
They shook out their legs as men do after a long
turn in the saddle and faced each other in a whispered
colloquy. An overcast sky, darkening the
night, concealed the alkali crusting the riders and
their horses; but the hard breathing of the latter
in the darkness told of a pace forced for some hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Find your feet before you go in, Pardaloe,&#8221;
suggested the heavier of the two men guardedly
to the taller one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does this man know you?&#8221; muttered the man
addressed as Pardaloe, stamping in the soft dust
and shifting slightly a gun harness on his breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pedro knows me,&#8221; returned Lefever, the other
man, &#8220;but McAlpin says there is a new man here,
a half-wit. They all belong to the same gang&ndash;&ndash;coiners,
I believe, every one of them. They work
here and push in Texas.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Can you spot the room when you get up-stairs,
where we saw that streak of light a minute
ago?&#8221; demanded Pardaloe, gazing at the black
front of the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can spot every foot of the place, up-stairs
and down, in the dark,&#8221; declared Lefever, peering
through the inky night at the ruinous pile.</p>
<p>Instead of meeting de Spain, as appointed, Lefever
had come in from the Thief River stage
with Scott three hours late only to learn of the
fight at the Inn and de Spain&#8217;s disappearance.
Jeffries had already sent a party, of whom Pardaloe,
a man of Farrell Kennedy&#8217;s from Medicine
Bend, had been picked up as one, down from
Sleepy Cat, to look for the missing man, and for
hours the search had gone forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you go back to the barn,&#8221; suggested
Pardaloe, &#8220;and wait there while I go in and have
a little talk with the landlord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, Pardaloe. That&#8217;s an idea,&#8221; assented
Lefever feebly. Then he laid the first two
fingers of his fat right hand on the lapel of his
companion&#8217;s coat: &#8220;Where should you like your body
sent?&#8221; he asked in feigned confidence. &#8220;Concerning
these little details, it&#8217;s just as well to
know your wishes now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose this boob will try to fight,
do you, when he knows Jeffries will burn the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
shack over his head if another railroad man is
attacked in it?&#8221; demanded Pardaloe.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most ruinous habit I have had in life&ndash;&ndash;and
first and last I have contracted many&ndash;&ndash;has
been, trusting other people,&#8221; observed Lefever.
&#8220;A man shouldn&#8217;t trust anybody&ndash;&ndash;not even himself.
We can burn the boob&#8217;s shack down&ndash;&ndash;of
course: but if you go in there alone the ensuing
blaze would be of no particular interest to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. We go in together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not exactly that, either. You go first. Few
of these forty-four bullets will go through two
men at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ignoring Lefever&#8217;s pleasantry, Pardaloe, pulling
his hat brim through force of habit well over
his eyes, shook himself loose and, like a big cat
walking in water, stepped toward the door. He
could move his tall, bony frame, seemingly covered
only with muscles and sinews, so silently
that in the dark he made no more sound than a
spectre. But once before the door, with Lefever
close at hand, he pounded the cracked panels till
the windows shook. Some time elapsed before
there was any response. The pounding continued
till a flickering light appeared at a window.
There was an ill-natured colloquy, a delay,
more impatience, and at length the landlord reluctantly
opened the door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>He held in his hand an oil-lamp. The chimney
had been smoked in such a way that the light of
the flame was thrown forward and not back.
Lefever in the background, nothing disturbed,
threw a flash-light back at the half-dressed innkeeper.
His hair was tumbled sleepily across his
forehead and his eyes&ndash;&ndash;one showing a white scar
across the pupil&ndash;&ndash;set deep in retreating orbits,
blinked under heavy brows. &#8220;What do you
want?&#8221; he demanded. Pardaloe, without answering,
pushed through the half-open door into
the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re staying here to-night,&#8221; announced Pardaloe,
as simply as possible. Lefever had already
edged into the doorway, pushing the stubborn
innkeeper aside by sheer bulk of weight and size.</p>
<p>The sleepy man gave ground stubbornly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got no beds,&#8221; he growled surlily. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever at once assumed the case for the intruders.
&#8220;I could sleep this minute standing on
my head,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;And as for staying
here, I can&#8217;t stay anywhere else. What&#8217;s your
name, son?&#8221; he demanded, buttonholing in his
off-hand way the protesting man.</p>
<p>&#8220;My name is Philippi,&#8221; answered the one-eyed
defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regards to Brutus, my dear fellow,&#8221; retorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Lefever, seizing the man&#8217;s hand as if happily
surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t crowd in here, so you might as well
move on,&#8221; declared Philippi gruffly. &#8220;This is no
hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever laughed. &#8220;No offense, Philippi, but
would it be indiscreet to ask which side of your
face hurts the most when you smile?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve got no beds, we won&#8217;t bother you
long,&#8221; interposed Pardaloe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like a pitcher of ice-water, anyway,&#8221; persisted
Lefever. &#8220;Sit down, noble Greek; we&#8217;ll
talk this over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you fellows?&#8221; demanded Philippi,
looking from one to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a prospector from the Purgatoire,&#8221; answered
Pardaloe.</p>
<p>Philippi turned his keen eye on Lefever. &#8220;You
a railroad man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; declared Lefever, dusting the alkali
vigorously from his coat sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>John looked as modest as it was possible for
him to look. &#8220;Few people ask me that, but in
matter of fact I am an <i>objet d&#8217;art</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Different things at different times to different
men, Philippi,&#8221; answered Lefever simply, exploring,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
while he spoke, different corners of the room
with his flash-light. &#8220;At this moment&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he
stopped suddenly, then resumed reassuringly&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I
want a drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; muttered the landlord sulkily.</p>
<p>Lefever&#8217;s flash-light focussed on a United States
license hanging back of the bar. &#8220;Is that a
mere frame-up, Philippi?&#8221; he demanded, walking
significantly toward the vender&#8217;s authority.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing in the house to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; announced Lefever calmly, &#8220;I arrest
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Philippi started. &#8220;Arrest me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For obtaining a thirst under false pretenses.
Come, now, before we slip the irons on, get us
something to eat. I&#8217;ll go up-stairs and pick out
a room to sleep in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; insisted Philippi profanely, &#8220;there
are no rooms for you to sleep in up-stairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; retorted Lefever, &#8220;tell you there are.
Anyway, I left a sewing-machine up-stairs here
three years ago, and promised to keep it oiled
for the lady. This is a good time to begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>With Lefever making the old steps creak,
ahead, and Pardaloe, with his long, soft, pigeon-toed
tread close behind, the unwilling landlord
was taken up the stairs, and the two men thoroughly
searched the house. Lefever lowered his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
voice when the hunt began through the bedrooms&ndash;&ndash;few
of which contained even a bed&ndash;&ndash;but he
kept up a running fire of talk that gave Philippi
no respite from anxiety.</p>
<p>Outside the kitchen quarters, which likewise
were rigorously searched, not a soul could be
found in the house. One room only, over the
kitchen, gave hope of uncovering something.
The party reached the door of this room through
a narrow, tortuous passageway along an attic
gable. The door was locked. Philippi told them
it belonged to a sheep-herder who did not use it
often. He protested he had no key. Pardaloe
knocked and, getting no response, tried unsuccessfully
to force the lock. Lefever motioned him
aside and, after knocking loudly on the door himself,
laid his shoulder against it. The door
creaked and sprung in crazy protest. The panels
cracked, the stubborn frame gave, and with a
violent crash Lefever pushed completely through
the locked barrier and threw his flash-light inside.
Pardaloe, urging the unwilling Philippi ahead,
followed.</p>
<p>The room, unfinished under the rafters, was
destitute of furnishings, and bore traces of long
disuse. Stretched on the floor toward the middle
of it, and side by side, lay two men. One of them
was very large, the other not more than half his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
companion&#8217;s size. Lefever kneeling over the man
nearest the door listened for signs of breathing,
and laid his head to the man&#8217;s heart. Having
completed his examination, he went around to
the other&ndash;&ndash;Pardaloe and Philippi silently watching&ndash;&ndash;and
looked him over with equal care. When
he had done, he examined, superficially, the
wounds of each man. Rising, he turned toward
Philippi. &#8220;Were these men dead when you
brought them up here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t bring &#8217;em up,&#8221; growled Philippi.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know them, Pardaloe?&#8221; asked Lefever.
Pardaloe answered that he did. Lefever turned
sharply on Philippi. &#8220;Where were you when
this fight was going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Down at the stage barn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Getting your alibi ready. But, of course,
you know that won&#8217;t let you out, Philippi. Your
best chance is to tell the truth. There were two
others with this pair&ndash;&ndash;where are Gale Morgan
and Sassoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Satt Morgan was here with hay to-day. He
took them over this evening to Music Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were they hit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan was hit in the shoulder, as far as I
heard. Sassoon was hit in the side, and in the
neck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is de Spain?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Dead, I reckon, by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s his body?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think he is dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sassoon said he was hit in the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet he got away on horseback!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you what Sassoon said; I didn&#8217;t
see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever and Pardaloe rode back to the stage
barn. &#8220;Certainly looks blue for Henry,&#8221; muttered
Lefever, after he had gone over with Pardaloe
and McAlpin all of the scant information
that could be gathered. &#8220;Bob Scott,&#8221; he added
gloomily, &#8220;may find him somewhere on the
Sinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Sleepy Cat, Jeffries, wild with impatience,
was on the telephone. Lefever, with McAlpin
and Pardaloe standing at his side, reported to
the superintendent all he could learn. &#8220;He rode
away&ndash;&ndash;without help, of course,&#8221; explained Lefever
to Jeffries in conclusion. &#8220;What shape he
is in, it&#8217;s pretty hard to say, Jeffries. Three more
of the bunch, Vance Morgan, Bull Page, and a
lame man that works for Bill Morgan, were waiting
in the saddle at the head of the draw between
the barn and the hotel for him if he should get
away from the inn. Somehow, he went the other
way and nobody saw hide nor hair of him, so far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
as I can learn. If he was able to make it, Jeff, he
would naturally try for Sleepy Cat. But that&#8217;s a
pretty fair ride for a sound man, let alone a man
that&#8217;s hit&ndash;&ndash;and everybody claims he was hit. If
he wasn&#8217;t hit he should have been in Sleepy Cat
long before this. You say you&#8217;ve had men out
across the river?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since dark,&#8221; responded Jeffries. &#8220;But, John,&#8221;
he asked, &#8220;could a man hit in the way de Spain
was hit, climb into a saddle and make a get-away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry might,&#8221; answered Lefever laconically.</p>
<p>Scott, with two men who had been helping him,
rode in at two o&#8217;clock after a fruitless search to
wait for light. At daybreak they picked up the
trail. Studying carefully the room in which the
fight had taken place, they followed de Spain&#8217;s
jump through the broken sash into the patio.
Blood that had been roughly cleaned up marked
the spot where he had mounted the horse and
dashed through an open corral gate down the
south trail toward Music Mountain. There was
speculation as to why he should have chosen a
route leading directly into the enemy&#8217;s country,
but there was no gainsaying the trail&ndash;&ndash;occasional
flecks of blood blazed the direction of the fleeing
hoofs. These led&ndash;&ndash;not as the trailers hoped they
would, in a wide d&eacute;tour across easy-riding country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
toward the north and the Sleepy Cat stage
road&ndash;&ndash;but farther and farther south and west
into extremely rough country, a no man&#8217;s land,
where there was no forage, no water, and no habitation.
Not this alone disquieted his pursuers;
the trail as they pursued it showed the unsteady
riding of a man badly wounded.</p>
<p>Lefever, walking his horse along the side of a
ridge, shook his head as he leaned over the pony&#8217;s
shoulder. Pardaloe and Scott rode abreast of
him. &#8220;It would take some hit, Bob, to bring de
Spain to this kind of riding.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the ridge they found where he had dismounted
for the first time. Here Scott picked up
five empty shells ejected from de Spain&#8217;s revolver.
They saw more than trace enough of how he had
tried to stanch the persistent flow from his
wounds. He seemed to have worked a long time
with these and with some success, for his trail
thereafter was less marked by blood. It was,
however, increasingly unsteady, and after a time
it reached a condition that led Scott to declare
de Spain was no longer guiding Sassoon&#8217;s pony;
it was wandering at will.</p>
<p>Confirmation, if it were needed, of the declaration
could soon be read in the trail by all of them.
The horse, unrestrained by its rider, had come almost
completely about and headed again for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Music Mountain. Within a few miles of the
snow-covered peak the hoof-prints ran directly
into the road from Calabasas to Morgan&#8217;s Gap
and were practically lost in the dust of the wagon
road.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a go,&#8221; muttered Pardaloe at fault,
after riding back and forth for a mile in an effort
to pick the horse up again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember,&#8221; interposed Scott mildly, &#8220;he
is riding Sassoon&#8217;s horse&ndash;&ndash;the brute is naturally
heading for home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Follow him home, then,&#8221; said Lefever unhesitatingly.</p>
<p>Scott looked at his companion in surprise:
&#8220;Near home, you mean, John,&#8221; he suggested inoffensively.
&#8220;For three of us to ride into the Gap
this morning would be some excitement for the
Morgans. I don&#8217;t think the excitement would
last long&ndash;&ndash;for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three were agreed, however, to follow up
to the mouth of the Gap itself and did follow.
Finding no trace of de Spain&#8217;s movements in this
quest, they rode separately in wide circles to the
north and south, but without picking up a hoof-print
that led anywhere or gave them any clew
to the whereabouts of the missing man.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one consolation,&#8221; muttered Lefever,
as they held to what each felt to be an almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
hopeless search. &#8220;As long as Henry can stick to a
saddle he can shoot&ndash;&ndash;and the Morgans after yesterday
afternoon will think twice before they
close in on him, if they find him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott shook his head: &#8220;That brings us up
against another proposition, John. De Spain
hasn&#8217;t got any cartridges.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever turned sharply: &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His belt is in the barn at Calabasas, hanging
up with his coat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me that before,&#8221; demanded
Lefever indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been hoping all the time we&#8217;d find Henry
and I wouldn&#8217;t have to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of the hope advanced by Lefever that
de Spain might by some chance have cartridges
in his pocket, Scott&#8217;s information was disquieting.
However, it meant for de Spain, they knew, only
the greater need of succor, and when the news of
his plight was made known later in the day to
Jeffries, efforts to locate him were redoubled.</p>
<p>For a week the search continued day and night,
but each day, even each succeeding hour, reduced
the expectation of ever seeing the hunted
man alive. Spies working at Calabasas, others
sent in by Jeffries to Music Mountain among the
Morgans, and men from Medicine Bend haunting
Sleepy Cat could get no word of de Spain. Fairly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
accurate reports accounted for Gale Morgan,
nursing a wound at home, and for Sassoon, badly
wounded and under cover somewhere in the Gap.
Beyond this, information halted.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the week a Mexican sheep-herder
brought word in to Lefever that he had
seen in Duke Morgan&#8217;s stable, Sassoon&#8217;s horse&ndash;&ndash;the
one on which de Spain had escaped. He
averred he had seen the blood-stained Santa Fe
saddle that had been taken off the horse when
the horse was found at daybreak of the day following
the fight, waiting at Sassoon&#8217;s corral to be
cared for. There could be, it was fairly well ascertained,
no mistake about the horse: the man
knew the animal; but his information threw no
light on the fate of its missing rider.</p>
<p>Though Scott had known first of de Spain&#8217;s
helpless condition in his desperate flight, as regarded
self-defense, the Indian was the last to
abandon hope of seeing him alive again. One
night, in the midst of a gloomy council at Jeffries&#8217;s
office, he was pressed for an explanation of his
confidence. It was always difficult for Scott to
explain his reasons for thinking anything. Men
with the surest instinct are usually poorest at
reasoning a conviction out. But, Bob, cross-examined
and harried, managed to give some explanation
of the faith that was in him. &#8220;In the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
first place,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve ridden a good deal
with that man&ndash;&ndash;pretty much all over the country
north of Medicine Bend. He is as full of tricks
as a nut&#8217;s full of meat. Henry de Spain can hide
out like an Indian and doctor himself. Then,
again, I know something about the way he fights;
up here, they don&#8217;t. If those four fellows had
ever seen him in action they never would have
expected to get out of a room alive, after a showdown
with Henry de Spain. As near as I can
make out from all the talk that&#8217;s floating around,
what fooled them was seeing him shoot at a mark
here one day in Sleepy Cat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeffries didn&#8217;t interrupt, but he slapped his
knee sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might just as well try to stand on a box
of dynamite, and shoot into it, and expect to live
to tell it,&#8221; continued Scott mildly, &#8220;as to shoot
into that fellow in a room with closed doors and
expect to get away with it. The only way the
bunch can ever kill that man, without getting
killed themselves, is to get him from behind;
and at that, John, the man that fires the gun,&#8221;
murmured the scout, &#8220;ought to be behind a tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say he is hit. I grant it,&#8221; he concluded.
&#8220;But I knew him once when he was hit to lie out
in the bush for a week. He got cut off once
from Whispering Smith and Kennedy after a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
scrimmage outside Williams Cache two years
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe, then, he&#8217;s dead, Bob?&#8221;
demanded Jeffries impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till I see him dead,&#8221; persisted Scott unmoved.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>ON MUSIC MOUNTAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>De Spain, when he climbed into Sassoon&#8217;s
saddle, was losing sight and consciousness.
He knew he could no longer defend himself, and
was so faint that only the determination of putting
distance between him and any pursuers held
him to the horse after he spurred away. With the
instinct of the hunted, he fumbled with his right
hand for his means of defense, and was relieved
to find his revolver, after his panicky dash for
safety, safe in its place. He put his hand to his
belt for fresh cartridges. The belt was gone.</p>
<p>The discovery sent a shock through his failing
faculties. He could not recollect why he had no
belt. Believing his senses tricked him, he felt
again and again for it before he would believe it
was not buckled somewhere about him. But it
was gone, and he stuck back in his waistband his
useless revolver. One hope remained&ndash;&ndash;flight, and
he spurred his horse cruelly.</p>
<p>Blood running continually into his eyes from
the wound in his head made him think his eyes
were gone, and direction was a thing quite beyond
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
his power to compass. He made little effort to
guide, and his infuriated horse flew along as if
winged.</p>
<p>A warm, sticky feeling in his right boot warned
him, when he tried to make some mental inventory
of his condition, of at least one other wound.
But he found he could inventory nothing, recollect
next to nothing, and all that he wanted to do was
to escape. More than once he tried to look behind,
and he dashed his hand across his red
forehead. He could not see twenty feet ahead
or behind. Even when he hurriedly wiped the
cloud from his eyes his vision seemed to have
failed, and he could only cling to his horse to put
the miles as fast as possible between himself and
more of the Morgans.</p>
<p>A perceptible weakness presently forced him
to realize he must look to his wounded foot.
This he did without slackening speed. The sight
of it and the feeling inside his torn and blood-soaked
boot was not reassuring, but he rode on,
sparing neither his horse nor his exhaustion.
It was only when spells of dizziness, recurring
with frequency, warned him he could not keep
the saddle much longer, that he attempted to
dismount to stanch the drip of blood from his
stirrup.</p>
<p>Before he slackened speed he tried to look behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
to reconnoitre. With relief he perceived
his sight to be a trifle better, and in scanning the
horizon he could discover no pursuers. Choosing
a secluded spot, he dismounted, cut open his boot,
and found that a bullet, passing downward, had
torn an artery under the arch of the foot. Making
a rude tourniquet, he succeeded in checking
pretty well the spurting flow that was sapping
his strength. After he had adjusted the bandage
he stood up and looked at it. Then he drew his
revolver again and broke it. He found five
empty shells in the chambers and threw them
away. The last cartridge had not been fired.
He could not even figure out how he had happened
to have six cartridges in the cylinder, for
he rarely loaded more than five. Indeed, it was
his fixed habit&ndash;&ndash;to avoid accidents&ndash;&ndash;never to
carry a cartridge under the hammer of his gun&ndash;&ndash;yet
now there had been one. Without trying to
explain the circumstance, he took fresh stock of
his chances and began to wonder whether he
might yet escape and live.</p>
<p>He climbed again into the saddle, and, riding
to a ridge, looked carefully over the desert. It
was with an effort that he could steady himself,
and the extent of his weakness surprised him.
What further perplexed him as he crossed a long
divide, got another good view and saw no pursuit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
threatening in any direction, was to identify the
country he was in. The only landmark anywhere
in sight that he could recognize was Music Mountain.
This now lay to the northwest, and he
knew he must be a long way from any country
he was familiar with. But there was no gainsaying,
even in his confused condition, Music
Mountain. After looking at it a long time he
headed with some hesitation cautiously toward it,
with intent to intercept the first trail to the northeast.
This would take him toward Sleepy Cat.</p>
<p>As his eyes continued to sweep the horizon he
noted that the sun was down and it was growing
dark. This brought a relief and a difficulty. It
left him less in fear of molestation, but made it
harder for him to reach a known trail. The horse,
in spite of the long, hard ride seemed fresh yet,
and de Spain, with one cartridge would still have
laughed at his difficulties had he not realized,
with uneasiness, that his head was becoming very
light. Recurring intervals of giddiness foreshadowed
a new danger in his uncharted ride.
It became again a problem for him to keep his
seat in the saddle. He was aware at intervals
that he was steadying himself like a drunken
man. His efforts to guide the horse only bewildered
the beast, and the two travelled on
maudlin curves and doubled back on their track
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
until de Spain decided that his sole chance of
reaching any known trail was to let go and give
the horse his head.</p>
<p>A starless night fell across the desert. With
danger of pursuit practically ended, and only a
chance encounter to fear, de Spain tried to help
himself by walking the horse and resting his
bleeding foot in front of the pommel, letting the
pony pick his way as he chose. A period of unconsciousness,
a blank in de Spain&#8217;s mind, soon
followed the slowing up. He came to himself as
he was lurching out of the saddle. Pulling himself
together, he put the wet foot in the stirrup
again and clung to the pommel with his hands.
How long he rode in this way, or how far, he
never knew. He was roused to consciousness
by the unaccustomed sound of running water
underneath his horse&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>It was pitch dark everywhere. The horse after
the hard experience of the evening was drinking
a welcome draft. De Spain had no conception
of where he could be, but the stream told
him he had somehow reached the range, though
Music Mountain itself had been swallowed up
in the night. A sudden and uncontrollable thirst
seized the wounded man. He could hear the water
falling over the stones and climbed slowly and
painfully out of the saddle to the ground. With
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
the lines in his left hand he crawled toward the
water and, lying flat on the ground beside the
horse, put his head down to drink. The horse,
meantime, satisfied, lifted his head with a gulp,
rinsed his mouth, and pulled backward. The
lines slipped from de Spain&#8217;s hand. Alarmed,
the weakened man scrambled after them. The
horse, startled, shied, and before his rider could
get to his feet scampered off in a trot. While de
Spain listened in consternation, the escaped horse,
falling into an easy stride, galloped away into the
night.</p>
<p>Stunned by this new misfortune, and listening
gloomily to the retreating hoof-beats, de Spain
pondered the situation in which the disaster left
him. It was the worst possible blow that could
have fallen, but fallen it had, and he turned with
such philosophy as he could to complete the
drink of water that had probably cost him his
life. At least, cold water never tasted sweeter,
never was so grateful to his parched tongue, and
since the price of the draft might be measured
by life itself, he drank extravagantly, stopping at
times to rest and, after breathing deeply, to drink
again.</p>
<p>When he had slaked a seemingly unquenchable
craving, he dashed the running water, first
with one hand and then the other, over his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
He tried feebly to wash away some of the alkali
that had crusted over the wound in the front of
his head and was stinging and burning in it.
There was now nothing to do but to secrete himself
until daylight and wait till help should reach
him&ndash;&ndash;it was manifestly impossible for him to
seek it.</p>
<p>Meantime, the little stream beside him offered
first aid. He tried it with his foot and found it
slight and shallow, albeit with a rocky bed that
made wading in his condition difficult. But he
felt so much better he was able to attempt this,
and, keeping near to one side of the current, he
began to follow it slowly up-stream. The ascent
was at times precipitous, which pleased him,
though it depleted his new strength. It was easy
in this way to hide his trail, and the higher and
faster the stream took him into the mountains
the safer he would be from any Calabasas pursuers.
When he had regained a little strength and
oriented himself, he could quickly get down into
the hills.</p>
<p>Animated by these thoughts, he held his way
up-stream, hoping at every step to reach the
gorge from which the flow issued. He would
have known this by the sound of the falling water,
but, weakening soon, he found he must abandon
hope of getting up to it. However, by resting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
and scrambling up the rocks, he kept on longer
than he would have believed possible. Encountering
at length, as he struggled upward, a ledge
and a clump of bushes, he crawled weakly on
hands and knees into it, too spent to struggle
farther, stretched himself on the flattened brambles
and sank into a heavy sleep.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He woke in broad daylight. Consciousness
returned slowly and he raised himself with pain
from his rough couch. His wounds were stiff,
and he lay for a long time on his back looking up
at the sky. At length he dragged himself to an
open space near where he had slept and looked
about. He appeared to be near the foot of a
mountain quite strange to him, and in rather an
exposed place. The shelter that had served him
for the night proved worthless in daylight and,
following his strongly developed instinct of self-preservation,
de Spain started once more up the
rocky path of the stream. He clambered a hundred
feet above where he had slept before he
found a hiding-place. It was at the foot of a tiny
waterfall where the brook, striking a ledge of
granite, had patiently hollowed out a shallow
pool. Beside this a great mass of frost-bitten
rock had fallen, and one of the bowlders lay tilted
in such a way as to roof in a sort of cave, the entrance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
to which was not higher than a man&#8217;s knee.
De Spain crawled into this refuge. He conceived
that from this high, open ledge he could show a
small signal-fire at night, and if it were answered
by his enemies he had a semblance of a retreat
under the fallen rock, a hunting-knife, and one
lone cartridge to protect himself with. A mountain-lion
might have to be reckoned with; and if
a pursuer should follow him under the rock his
only chance would lie in getting hold, after a
fight, of the man&#8217;s loaded revolver or ammunition-belt.
Such a hope involved a great deal of
confidence, but de Spain was an optimist&ndash;&ndash;most
railroad men are.</p>
<p>The outlook was, in truth, not altogether cheerful&ndash;&ndash;some
would have called it, for a wounded
man, desperate&ndash;&ndash;but it had some slight consolations
and de Spain was not given to long-range
forebodings. The rising sun shone in a glory of
clearness, and the cool night air rolling up the
mountain was grateful and refreshing. Lying
flat on the rock, he stretched his head forward
and drank deeply of the ice-cold pool beside
which he lay. The violent exertion of reaching
the height had started the ruptured artery anew,
and his first work was crudely to cleanse the
wound and attempt to rebandage it. He was
hungry, but for this there was only one alleviation&ndash;&ndash;sleep&ndash;&ndash;and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
carefully effacing all traces of
his presence on the ledge, he crawled into his rock
retreat and fell again into a heavy slumber.</p>
<p>It was this repose that proved his undoing.
He woke to consciousness so weak he could
scarcely lift his head. It was still day. A consuming
thirst assailed him, but he lacked the
strength to crawl out of his cave, and, looking
toward his bandaged foot, he was shocked at the
sight of how it had bled while he slept. When
he could rally from his discouragement he rewound
the bandages and told himself what a fool
he had been to drag his foot up the rocks before
the wound had had any chance to heal. He resolved,
despite his thirst, to lie still all day and
give the artery absolute quiet. It required only a
little stoicism; the stake was life.</p>
<p>Toward afternoon his restlessness increased,
but he clung to his resolve to lie still. By evening
he was burning with thirst, and when morning
came after a feverish night, with his head on fire
and his mouth crusted dry, he concluded rightly
that one or both of his wounds had become infected.</p>
<p>De Spain understood what it meant. He
looked regretfully at the injured foot. Swollen
out of shape and angry-looking, the mere appearance
would have told him, had the confirmation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
been needed, that his situation was becoming
critical. This did not so much disconcert him as
it surprised him and spurred him mentally to the
necessity of new measures. He lay a long time
thinking. Against the infection he could do little.
But the one aid at his hand was abundance of
cold water to drink and bathe his wound in, and
to this he resolved now to drag himself. To crawl
across the space that separated him from the
pool required all the strength he could summon.
The sun was already well up and its rays shot like
spectrum arrows through the spray of the dainty
cataract, which spurted in a jewelled sheet over a
rocky ledge twenty feet above and poured noisily
down from the broad pool along jagged bowlders
below.</p>
<p>Crawling, choking with thirst, slowly forward,
he reached the water, and, reclining on his side
and one elbow, he was about to lean down to
drink when he suddenly felt, with some kind of
an instinctive shock, that he was no longer alone
on the ledge. He had no interest in analyzing
the conviction; he did not even question it.
Not a sound had reached his ears. Only a moment
before he had looked carefully all around.
But the field of his vision was closely circumscribed
by the walls about him. It was easy for
an invader to come on his retreat unawares&ndash;&ndash;at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
all events, somebody, he was almost sure, stood
behind him. The silence meant an enemy. The
first thing to expect was a bullet. It would probably
be aimed at the back of his head. At least
he knew this was the spot to aim for to kill a
man instantly and painlessly&ndash;&ndash;yet he shrank
from that anticipated crash.</p>
<p>And it was this thought that cost the defenseless
man at the moment the most pain&ndash;&ndash;that
feeling, in advance, of the blow of the bullet that
should snuff out his life. Defense was out of
the question; he was as helpless as a baby. An
impulse in his fingers to clutch his revolver he
restrained at once&ndash;&ndash;it could only hasten his death.
He wondered, as the seconds passed, why his
executioner hesitated to shoot, but he could not
rid himself of the mental horror of being shot in
the base of the brain. Anywhere else he would
have almost welcomed a bullet; anywhere else
it might have given him one chance for life
through rolling over after he was struck in an
attempt to kill his assailant.</p>
<p>His thoughts, working in flashes of lightning,
suggested every possible trick of escape, and as
rapidly rejected each. There was nothing for it
but to play the part, to take the blow with no
more than a quiver when it came. He had once
seen a man shot in just that way. Braced to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
such a determination, de Spain bent slowly downward,
and, with eyes staring into the water for a
reflection that might afford a glimpse of his enemy,
he began to drink. A splash above his head
frightened him almost to death. It was a water ousel
dashing into the foaming cataract and out
again, and the spray falling from the sudden
bath wrecked the mirror of the pool. De Spain
nearly choked. Each mouthful of water was a
struggle. The sense of impending death had
robbed even the life-giving drafts of their tonic;
each instant carried its acute sensation of being
the last. At length, his nerves weakened by
hunger and exposure, revolted under the strain.
Suppose it should be, after all, a fantasy of his
fever that pictured so vividly an enemy behind.
With an effort that cost more mental torture
than he ever had known, he drew back on his
elbow from the pool, steadied himself, turned his
head to face his executioner, and confronted
Nan Morgan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>PARLEY</h3>
</div>
<p>She stood beside the rock from which the
ledge was reached from below, and as if she
had just stepped up into sight. Her rifle was so
held in both hands that it could be fired from
her hip, and at such close quarters with deadly
accuracy. As she stood with startled eyes fixed
on his haggard face, her slender neck and poised
head were very familiar to de Spain.</p>
<p>And her expression, while it reflected her horrified
alarm, did not conceal her anger and aversion
at the sight of him. Unaware of the forbidding
spectacle he presented, de Spain, swept
by a brainstorm at the appearance of this Morgan&ndash;&ndash;the
only one of all the Morgans he had not
fancied covering him and waiting to deliver his
death-warrant&ndash;&ndash;felt a fury sweep over him at
the thought of being shot by a woman. The
wild idea that she meant to kill him, which
in a rational moment would never have entered
his mind, now in his delirium completely obsessed
him. Working, as it were, mechanically, even
the instinct of self-defense asserted itself against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
her. But enough of reason remained in his disordered
senses to tell him that self-defense was
out of the question. Whatever she meant to
do, he could no more fire at this girl, even had
he a chance&ndash;&ndash;and he realized he was at her mercy&ndash;&ndash;than
he could at his sister; and he lay with his
eyes bent on hers, trying to read her purpose.</p>
<p>She stood guarded, but motionless with surprise.
De Spain turned himself slowly and, sitting
up, waited for her to speak. There was little
to hope for, he thought, in her expression. And
all of his duplicity seemed to desert him before
her cold resolution. The tricks he would have
tried, at bay before a man, he felt no inclination
to attempt. He read in her set face only abhorrence
and condemnation, and felt in no way
moved to argue her verdict. &#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he
said, at length, not trying to disguise his bitter
resentment of her presence, &#8220;you&#8217;ve come to
finish me.&#8221;</p>
<p>His shirt stained and tattered for bandages, his
hair matted in blood on his forehead, his eyes inflamed
and sunken, his lips crusted and swollen,
the birthmark fastened vividly on his cheek made
him a desperate sight. Regarding him steadily,
Nan, as bewildered as if she had suddenly come
on a great wounded beast of prey still dangerous,
made no response to his words. The two stared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
at each other defiantly and for another moment
in silence. &#8220;If you are going to kill me,&#8221; he continued,
looking into her eyes without any thought
of appeal, &#8220;do it quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something in his long, unyielding gaze impelled
her to break the spell of it. &#8220;What are you doing
here?&#8221; she demanded with anger, curbing her
voice to control her excitement as best she could.</p>
<p>De Spain, still looking at her, answered only
after a pause. &#8220;Hiding,&#8221; he said harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiding to kill other men!&#8221; Nan&#8217;s accusation
as she clutched her rifle was almost explosive.</p>
<p>He regarded her coolly, and with the interval
he had had for thinking, his wits were clearing.
&#8220;Do I look like a man hunting for a fight? Or,&#8221;
he added, since she made no answer, &#8220;like a man
hunting for a quiet spot to die in? How,&#8221; he
went on slowly, delirium giving place to indignation,
&#8220;can you say I&#8217;m hiding here to kill other
men? That&#8217;s what your people tell you, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you are a murderer.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of his weakness he flushed. &#8220;No,&#8221; he
exclaimed sharply, &#8220;I&#8217;m not a murderer. If you
think it&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he pointed contemptuously to her
side&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;you have your rifle&ndash;&ndash;use it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My rifle is to defend myself with. I am not
a public executioner,&#8221; she answered scornfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You need no rifle to defend yourself from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
me&ndash;&ndash;though I am a murderer. And if you&#8217;re not
a public executioner, leave me&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m dying fast
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You came here to hide to kill somebody!&#8221;
she exclaimed, as if the thought were a sudden
explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;here&#8217;? I might better
ask why you came here,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know where I am. Do I look as if I came
here by choice?&#8221; He paused. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; he
said, quite master of himself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why
I came. I shall never get away alive, anyway&ndash;&ndash;you
can have the truth if you want it. I got off
my horse in the night to get a drink. He bolted.
I couldn&#8217;t walk. I climbed up here to hide till
my wounds heal. Now, I&#8217;ve told you the truth.
Where am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>The grip of her hands on the rifle might have
relaxed somewhat, but she saw his deadly revolver
in its accustomed place and did not mean to
surrender her command of him. Nor would she
tell him where he was. She parried his questions.
He could get no information of any sort out of
her. Yet he saw that something more than his
mere presence detained and perplexed her. Her
prompt condemnation of him rankled in his mind,
and the strain of facing her suspicion wore on
him. &#8220;I won&#8217;t ask you anything more,&#8221; he said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
at length. &#8220;You do right to give me no information.
It might help me save my life. I can&#8217;t
talk any longer. You know you think I&#8217;ve no
right to live&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s what you think, isn&#8217;t it?
Why don&#8217;t you shoot?&#8221; She only stared at him.
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer?&#8221; he demanded recklessly.</p>
<p>Nan summoned her resolution. &#8220;I know you
tried to kill my cousin,&#8221; she said hotly, after he
had taunted her once more. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t know
you won&#8217;t try it again as soon as you are able.
And I am going to think what to do before I
tell you anything or do anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I tried to kill your cousin! You
know nothing of the kind. Your cousin tried to
kill me. He&#8217;s a bully and a coward, a man that
doesn&#8217;t know what fair fighting means. Tell
him that for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are safe in abusing him when he&#8217;s not
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Send him to me! This is no place for a woman
that calls me what you call me&ndash;&ndash;send your cousin
and all his friends!&#8221; His voice shook with anger.
&#8220;Tell him I&#8217;m wounded; tell him I&#8217;ve had nothing
to eat since I fought him before. And if he&#8217;s
still afraid&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;de Spain drew and broke his revolver
almost like a flash. In that incredibly
quick instant she realized he might have threatened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
her life before she could move a muscle&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;tell
your fine cousin I&#8217;ve got one cartridge
left&ndash;&ndash;just one!&#8221; So saying, he held in one hand
the loaded cartridge and in the other the empty
revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think little of bloodshed, I know,&#8221; she
returned unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a whole lot,&#8221; he drawled in painful
retort, &#8220;of fair fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m a woman&ndash;&ndash;you do well to taunt me
with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not taunt you with it. You are hatefully
unjust,&#8221; he protested sullenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve asked me to go&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m going. How
much of what you tell me is true, I don&#8217;t know.
But I can believe my own eyes, and I believe you
are not in condition to do much injury, even if
you came here with that intention. You will
certainly lose your life if you move from your
hiding-place.&#8221;</p>
<p>She started away. He leaned toward her.
&#8220;Stop,&#8221; he said peremptorily, raising himself
with a wrenching effort. Something in the stern
eye held her. His extended hand pointed toward
her as arbitrarily as if, instead of lying helpless
at her feet, he could command her to his bidding.
&#8220;I want to ask you a question. I&#8217;ve told you the
truth. I have just one cartridge. If you are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
going to send your cousin and his men here, it&#8217;s
only fair I should know it now&ndash;&ndash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was hard in spite of the weakness he
struggled to conceal. It annoyed her to think
he had surmised she was revolving in her mind
what to do. He was demanding an answer she
had not yet given to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;My cousin is wounded,&#8221; she said, pausing.
And then with indecision: &#8220;If you stay here
quietly you are not likely to be molested.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped down from the ledge as noiselessly
as she had come. Shaken by the discovery she
had so unexpectedly made, Nan retreated almost
precipitately from the spot. And the question
of what to do worried her as much as it worried
de Spain. The whole range had been shaken by
the Calabasas fight. Even in a country where
appeal to arms was common, where men were
ready to snuff out a life for a word, or kill for a
mess of pottage&ndash;&ndash;to settle for the least grave offense
a dispute with a shot&ndash;&ndash;the story of the surprising,
unequal, and fatal encounter of the Calabasas
men with de Spain, and of his complete
disappearance after withstanding almost unheard-of
odds, was more than a three days&#8217; wonder;
nothing else was talked of for weeks. Even the
men in Morgan&#8217;s Gap, supposed to be past masters
of the game played in the closed room at Calabasas,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
had been stunned by the issue of the few
minutes with Jeffries&#8217;s new man.</p>
<p>Nan, who had heard but one side of the story,
pictured the aggressor from the tale of the two
who lived to tell of the horribly sharp action
with him. Morning, noon, and night she had
heard nothing but the fight at Calabasas discussed
by the men that rode in and out of the
Gap&ndash;&ndash;and in connection with it, de Spain&#8217;s unexplained
flight and disappearance. Those that
knew the real story of the conspiracy to kill him
did not talk much, after the disastrous outcome,
of that part of the affair. But Nan&#8217;s common
sense whispered to her, whatever might be said
about de Spain&#8217;s starting the fight, that one man
locked in a room with four enemies, all dangerous
in an affray, was not likely to begin a fight unless
forced to&ndash;&ndash;none, at least, but a madman would
do so. She had heard stories, too, of de Spain&#8217;s
drinking and quarrelling, but none that told
them had ever seen him under the influence of
drink or had had a quarrel with him except Gale
and Sassoon&ndash;&ndash;and these two were extremely
quarrelsome.</p>
<p>Unhappy and irresolute, Nan, when she got
home, was glad of an excuse to ride to Calabasas
for a packet of dressings coming by stage from
Sleepy Cat for Gale, who lay wounded at Satt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
Morgan&#8217;s; and, eating a hasty luncheon, she ordered
her horse and set out.</p>
<p>Should she tell her Uncle Duke of finding de
Spain? Whenever she decided that she must,
something in the recollection of de Spain&#8217;s condition
unsettled her resolution. Tales enough of his
bloodthirstiness, his merciless efficiency, his ever-ready
craft and consummate duplicity were familiar
to her&ndash;&ndash;most of them made so within the
last three days&ndash;&ndash;for no one in her circle any
longer professed to underrate the demonstrated
resourcefulness of the man.</p>
<p>Yet only a few of these stories appealed to Nan&#8217;s
innate convictions of truth and justice. She
lived among men who were, for the most part,
not truthful or dependable even in small things&ndash;&ndash;how
could they be relied on to tell the truth
about de Spain&#8217;s motives and conduct? As to
his deadly skill with arms, no stories were needed
to confirm this, even though she herself had once
overcome him in a contest. The evidence of
this mastery had now a fatal pre-eminence among
the tragedies of the Spanish Sinks. Where he
lay he could, if he meditated revenge on her
people, murder any of them, almost at will. To
spare his life imperilled to this extent theirs&ndash;&ndash;but
surely he lay not far from death by exhaustion.
Weighed against all she had ever listened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
to concerning his deceit was the evidence of her
own sight. She had seen men desperately ill,
and men desperately stricken. This man was
either both or she could never again believe her
senses. And if he was not helped soon he would
die.</p>
<p>But who was to help him? Certainly none of
his friends could know where he was hidden or
of his plight&ndash;&ndash;no help could come from them unless
she told them. If she told them they would
try to reach him. That would mean an appalling&ndash;&ndash;an
unthinkable&ndash;&ndash;fight. If she told her
uncle, could she keep him from killing de Spain?
She believed not. He might promise to let him
go. But she knew her uncle&#8217;s ferocious resentment,
and how easy it would be for him to give
her fine words and, in spite of them, for de Spain
to be found dead some morning where he lay&ndash;&ndash;there
were plenty of men available for jobs such
as that.</p>
<p>All came back to one terrifying alternative:
Should she help this wretched man herself? And
if he lived, would he repay her by shooting some
one of her own kin?</p>
<p>The long ride to Calabasas went fast as the
debate swept on, and the vivid shock of her
strange experience recurred to her imagination.</p>
<p>She drew up before the big barn. Jim McAlpin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
was coming out to go to supper. Nan asked for her
package and wanted to start directly back again.
McAlpin refused absolutely to hear of it. He
looked at her horse and professed to be shocked.
He told her she had ridden hard, urged her to
dismount, and sent her pony in to be rubbed,
assuring Nan heartily there was not a man, outside
the hostlers, within ten miles. While her
horse was cared for, McAlpin asked, in his harmless
Scotch way, about Gale.</p>
<p>Concerning Gale, Nan was non-committal. But
she listened with interest, more or less veiled, to
whatever running comment McAlpin had to offer
concerning the Calabasas fight. &#8220;And I was
sorry to see Gale mixed up in it,&#8221; he concluded,
in his effort to draw Nan out, &#8220;sorry. And sorrier
to think of Henry de Spain getting killed that
way. Why, I knowed Henry de Spain when he
was a baby in arms.&#8221; He put out his hand cannily.
&#8220;I worked for his father before he was
born.&#8221; His listener remained obdurate. There
was nothing for it except further probing, to which,
however, Jim felt abundantly equal. &#8220;Some say,&#8221;
he suggested, looking significantly toward the
door of the barn, and significantly away again,
&#8220;that Henry went down there to pick a fight
with the boys. But,&#8221; he asserted cryptically,
&#8220;I happen to know <i>that</i> wasn&#8217;t so.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Then what did he go down there for?&#8221; demanded
Nan indignantly, but not warily.</p>
<p>McAlpin, the situation now in hand, took his
time to it. He leaned forward in a manner calculated
to invite confidence without giving offense.
&#8220;Miss Nan,&#8221; said he simply, &#8220;I worked for your
Uncle Duke for five years&ndash;&ndash;you know that.&#8221;
Nan had, at least, heard it fifty times. &#8220;I think
a good deal of him&ndash;&ndash;I think a good deal of you,
so does the missus, so does little Loretta&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s
always asking about you, the child is&ndash;&ndash;and I
hear and see a good deal here that other people
don&#8217;t get next to&ndash;&ndash;they can&#8217;t. Now Henry de
Spain was here, with me, sitting right there where
you are sitting, Miss Nan, in that chair,&#8221; declared
McAlpin with an unanswerable finger, &#8220;not fifteen
minutes before that fight began, he was there. I
told you he never went down there to fight. Do
you want the proof? I&#8217;ll tell you&ndash;&ndash;I wouldn&#8217;t
want anybody else to know&ndash;&ndash;will you keep it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan seemed indifferent. &#8220;Girls are not supposed
to keep secrets,&#8221; she said obstinately.</p>
<p>Her narrator was not to be balked. He pointed
to the coat-rack on the wall in front of them both.
&#8220;There is Henry de Spain&#8217;s coat. He hung it
there just before he went down to the inn. Under
it, if you look, you&#8217;ll find his belt of cartridges.
Don&#8217;t take my word&ndash;&ndash;look for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>Giving this information time to sink in, McAlpin
continued. Nan&#8217;s eyes had turned, despite
her indifference, to the coat; but she was
thinking more intently about the belt which
McAlpin asserted hung under it. &#8220;You want to
know what he did go down to the hotel for that
afternoon? I happen to know that, too,&#8221; averred
McAlpin, sitting down, but respectfully, on the
edge of the chair. &#8220;First I want to say this: I
worked for your Uncle Duke five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused to give Nan a chance to dispute
the statement if she so desired. Then taking her
despairing silence as an indorsement of his position
in giving her a confidence, he went on:
&#8220;Henry de Spain is dead,&#8221; he said quietly. She
eyed him without so much as winking. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t tell it if he wasn&#8217;t. Some of the boys
don&#8217;t believe he is. I&#8217;m not a pessimist&ndash;&ndash;not a
bit&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m telling you it&#8217;s a physical impossibility
for a man to take the fire of four revolvers
in the hands of four men like those four men, at
arm&#8217;s length, and live. Henry de Spain is the
cleverest man with a gun that ever rode the
Spanish Sinks, but limits is limits; the boy&#8217;s
dead. And he was always talking about you.
It&#8217;s God&#8217;s truth, and since he&#8217;s dead it harms
no one to tell it to you, though I&#8217;d never breathe
it to another. He was fairly gone on you. Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
that&#8217;s the fair truth: the man was gone on you.
I knowed it, where others didn&#8217;t know it. I was
the only one he could always ask about whether
you&#8217;d been here, and when; and when you might
be expected coming again&ndash;&ndash;and all such things
like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to knock me down, Miss
Nan, to put me wise about a man&#8217;s being keen
on a girl. I&#8217;m a married man,&#8221; declared McAlpin
with modest pride. &#8220;He thought all the
time he was fooling me, and keeping covered.
Why, I laughed to myself at his tricks to get information
without letting on! Now, that afternoon
he came in here kind of moody. It was an
anniversary for him, and a hard one&ndash;&ndash;the day his
father was shot from ambush&ndash;&ndash;a good many
years ago, but nary one of us had forgot it. Then
he happened to see your pony&ndash;&ndash;this same pony
you&#8217;re riding to-day&ndash;&ndash;a-standing back there in
the box-stall. He asked me whose it was; and
he asked me about you, and, by jinx! the way he
perked up when I told him you were coming in
on the stage that afternoon! When he heard
you&#8217;d been sick, he was for going down to the
hotel to get a cup of coffee&ndash;&ndash;for you!&#8221; McAlpin,
like any good story-teller, was already on his feet
again. &#8220;He did it,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;and you
know what <i>he</i> got when he stepped into the barroom.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
He took hold of de Spain&#8217;s coat and
held it aside to enter his exhibit. &#8220;There,&#8221; he
concluded, &#8220;is his cartridge-belt, hanging there
yet. The boy is dead&ndash;&ndash;why shouldn&#8217;t I tell you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan rode home much more excited, more bewildered
than when she had ridden over. What
should she do? It was already pretty clear to
her that de Spain had not ridden unarmed to
where she found him to ambush any of the Morgans.
He was not dead; but he was not far from
it if McAlpin was right and if she could credit
her own senses in looking at him. What ought
she to do?</p>
<p>Other things McAlpin had said crowded her
thoughts. Strangest shock of all that this man
of all other men should profess to care for her.
She had shown anger when McAlpin dared speak
of it; at least, she thought she had. And she
still did not know how, sufficiently, to resent
the thought of such audacity on de Spain&#8217;s part;
but recalling all she could of his words and actions,
she was forced to confess to herself that
McAlpin&#8217;s assertions were confirmed in them&ndash;&ndash;and
that what McAlpin had said interpreted de
Spain&#8217;s unvarying attitude toward her. This
was, to say the least, a further awkward complication
for her feelings. She already had enough
to confuse them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>NAN DRIFTS</h3>
</div>
<p>Without going in to speak to Gale, whom
Bull Page, his nurse, reported very cross
but not hurt much, Nan left her packet for him
and rode home. Her uncle Duke was in town.
She had the house to herself, with only Bonita,
the old Mexican serving-woman, and Nan ate her
late supper alone.</p>
<p>The longer she pondered on de Spain and his
dilemma&ndash;&ndash;and her own&ndash;&ndash;the more she worried.
When she went to bed, up-stairs in her little gable
room, she thought sleep&ndash;&ndash;never hard for her to
woo&ndash;&ndash;would relieve her of her anxiety for at
least the night. But she waited in vain for
sleep. She was continually asking herself whether
de Spain was really very badly hurt, or whether
he might be only tricking her into thinking he
was. Assailed by conflicting doubts, she tossed
on her pillow till a resolve seized her to go up
again to his hiding-place and see what she could
see or hear&ndash;&ndash;possibly, if one were on foot, she
could uncover a plot.</p>
<p>She dressed resolutely, buckled a holster to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
her side, and slipping a revolver&ndash;&ndash;a new one that
Gale had given her&ndash;&ndash;into it for protection, she
walked softly down-stairs and out of doors.</p>
<p>The night air was clear with a three-quarter
moon well up in the sky. She took her way
rapidly along the trail to the mountain, keeping
as much as possible within the great shadows
cast by the towering peaks. Not a sound met
her acute listening as she pressed on&ndash;&ndash;not a living
thing seemed to move anywhere in the whole
great Gap, except this slender-footed, keen-eyed
girl, whose heart beat with apprehension of wiles,
stratagems, and ambush concerning the venture
she was making.</p>
<p>Breathing stealthily and keyed to a tense feeling
of uncertainty and suspicion, Nan at length
found herself below the ledge where de Spain
was in hiding. She stopped and, with the craft
of an Indian, stood perfectly still for a very long
time before she began to climb up to where the
enemy lay. Hearing no sound, she took courage
and made the ascent. She reached without adventure
the corner of the ledge where she had
first seen him, and there, lying flat, listened again.</p>
<p>Hearing only the music of the little cascade,
she swept the ledge as well as she could with her
eyes, but it was now so far in shadow as to lie in
impenetrable darkness. Hardly daring to breathe,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
she crept and felt her way over it with her hands,
discovering nothing until she had almost reached
de Spain&#8217;s retreat at the farther side. Then her
heart stopped in an agony of fear&ndash;&ndash;underneath
the overhanging wall she heard voices.</p>
<p>To attempt to escape was as dangerous as to
lie still. Had she dared, she would have retreated
at once the way she came. Since she dared not,
she was compelled to hear what was said, and,
indeed, was eager to hear. De Spain had confederates,
then, and had tricked her, after all.
Whatever his plot, she was resolved to know it,
and instead of retreating she took her revolver
in hand and drew herself nearer. When she
had gained her new position the mutterings,
which had been indistinct, became audible. It
was not two voices she had heard, but one&ndash;&ndash;de
Spain, she judged, was talking in his sleep.</p>
<p>But a moment later this explanation failed
to satisfy her. The mutterings were too constant
and too disconnected to be mistaken for
sleep-talking&ndash;&ndash;it dawned on Nan that this must
be delirium. She could hear de Spain throwing
himself from side to side, and the near and far
sounds, as if of two voices, were explained. It
was possible now for her to tell herself she was
mistress of the situation. She crept nearer.</p>
<p>He was babbling in the chill darkness about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
ammunition, urging men to make haste, warning
them of some one coming. He turned on the
rock floor ceaselessly, sometimes toward her,
sometimes from her, muttering of horses, water,
passengers, wheels, wrecks. He made broken
appeals to be chopped out, directed men where
to use their axes. Nan listened to his ravings,
overcome by the revelation of his condition.
Once her uncle had lain sick of a fever and had
been delirious; but that, her sole experience, was
nothing to this. Once de Spain threw out a
groping hand and, before she could escape, caught
her skirt. Nan tried to pull away. His grip
did not loosen. She took his hand in hers and,
while he muttered meaningless words, forced his
fingers open and drew away. His hand was dry
and burning hot.</p>
<p>She told herself he must die if he remained
longer unaided, and there were unpleasant possibilities,
if he died where he lay. Such a death,
so close to her own home might, if it were ever
known, throw suspicion on her uncle and arouse
the deeper resentment of the wounded man&#8217;s
friends. If the least of pity played a part in
suggesting that her safest course was to help de
Spain, Nan kept its promptings as much as she
could in the penumbra of her thoughts. She
did not want to pity or to help him, she convinced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
herself; but she did not want his death
laid to a Morgan plot&ndash;&ndash;for none of his friends
would ever believe de Spain had found his way
alive and alone to where he lay.</p>
<p>All of this Nan was casting up in her mind
as she walked home. She had already decided,
but without realizing it, what to do, and was
willing to assume that her mind was still open.</p>
<p>Toward daylight of the morning, de Spain
dreamed he was not alone&ndash;&ndash;that a figure moved
silently in the faintness of the dawn&ndash;&ndash;a figure he
struggled to believe a reality, but one that tricked
his wandering senses and left him, at the coming
of another day, weaker, with failing courage, and
alone.</p>
<p>But when he opened his eyes later, and with a
clearer head, he found food and drink near.
Unable to believe his sight, he fancied his wavering
senses deceiving him, until he put out his
hand and felt actually the substance of what he
saw. He took up a bottle of milk incredulously,
and sipped at it with the caution of a man not
unused to periods of starvation. He broke eggs
and swallowed them, at intervals, hungrily from
the shell; and meat he cached, animal-like, in
near-by crannies and, manlike, in his pockets.</p>
<p>He was determined, if she should come again,
to intercept his visitor. For forty-eight hours
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
he tried cat-naps with an occasional sandwich
to keep up his strength. Nan returned unseen,
and disappeared despite his watchfulness. A new
supply of food proved she had been near, but that
it would be hard to time her coming.</p>
<p>When she did come, the third time, an innocent
snare discovered her presence. It was just before
day, and de Spain had so scattered small
obstacles&ndash;&ndash;handfuls of gravel and little chips of
rock&ndash;&ndash;that should she cross the ledge in the dark
she could hardly escape rousing him.</p>
<p>The device betrayed her. &#8220;I&#8217;m awake,&#8221; announced
de Spain at once from his retreat. When
she stopped at the words he could not see her;
she had flattened herself, standing, against a wall
of the ledge. He waited patiently. &#8220;You give
me no chance to thank you,&#8221; he went on after a
pause. Nan, drawing nearer, put down a small
parcel. &#8220;I don&#8217;t need any thanks,&#8221; she replied
with calculated coolness. &#8220;I am hoping when
you are well enough you will go away, quietly, in
the night. That will be the only way you can
thank me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be as glad to go as you can be to
have me,&#8221; rejoined de Spain. &#8220;But that won&#8217;t
be thanking you as I am going to. If you think
you can save my life and refuse my thanks as I
mean to express them&ndash;&ndash;you are mistaken. I will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
be perfectly honest. Lying out here isn&#8217;t just
what I&#8217;d choose for comfort. But if by doing it
I could see you once in two or three days&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t see me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No news could be worse. And if I can&#8217;t, I
don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to get out at all. I&#8217;ve
no horse&ndash;&ndash;you know that. I can&#8217;t stand on my
foot yet; if you had a light you might see for
yourself. I think I showed you my gun. If
you could tell me where I am&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He halted on the implied question. Nan took
ample time to reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me you don&#8217;t know where
you are?&#8221; she asked, and there was a touch of
vexed incredulity in her tone.</p>
<p>De Spain seemed unmoved by her scepticism.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you anything else,&#8221; he said simply.
&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have any idea I crawled up here
for the fun of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to think,&#8221; she returned, and
he perceived in the hardness of her voice how at
bay she felt in giving him the least bit of information,
&#8220;whether I ought to tell you anything at
all&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t very decently take any unfair advantage
after what you&#8217;ve done, could I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&ndash;&ndash;you are in Morgan&#8217;s Gap,&#8221; she said
swiftly, as if she wanted it off her mind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>There was no movement of surprise, neither
was there any answer. &#8220;I supposed, when I
found you here, you knew that,&#8221; she added less
resolutely; the darkness and silence were plainly
a strain.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you are telling the truth,&#8221; he responded
at length. &#8220;But I can hardly believe
it. That&#8217;s the reason, of course, you <i>did</i> find me.
I rode a good many miles that night without
knowing where I was or what I was doing. I
certainly never figured on winding up here. How
could I get in here without being stopped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody inside the Gap was outside hunting
for you, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much use asking where I am, in
the Gap. I never was inside but once. I shouldn&#8217;t
know if you did tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are at the foot of Music Mountain, about
a mile from where I live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have thought I meant to raid your
house. I didn&#8217;t. I was hit. I got mixed up in
trying to get away. You want me out of here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more than I want to get out. Perhaps by
to-morrow I could walk a few miles. I should
have to assassinate somebody to get some ammunition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be hard for you to do that, I
presume.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></div>
<p>Her words and her tone revealed the intensity
of her dislike and the depth of her distrust.</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment. Then he said,
without resentment: &#8220;You are ashamed already
of saying that, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not,&#8221; she answered defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are. You know it isn&#8217;t true. If you
believed it you never would have brought food
here to save my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought it to save some of my own people
from possible death at your hands&ndash;&ndash;to prevent
another fight&ndash;&ndash;to see if you hadn&#8217;t manhood
enough after being helped, to go away, when you
were able to move, peaceably. One cartridge
might mean one life, dear to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know whose life you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know nothing about what I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know better than you know yourself. If I
believed you, I shouldn&#8217;t respect you. Fear and
mercy are two different things. If I thought
you were only afraid of me, I shouldn&#8217;t think much
of your aid. Listen&ndash;&ndash;I never took the life of any
man except to defend my own&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No murderer that ever took anybody&#8217;s life in
this country ever said anything but that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t class me with murderers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are known from one end of the country
to the other as a gunman.&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered impassively: &#8220;Did these men who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
call me a gunman ever tell you why I&#8217;m one?&#8221;
She seemed in too hostile a mood to answer. &#8220;I
guess not,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Let me tell you now.
The next time you hear me called a gunman
you can tell them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t listen,&#8221; she exclaimed, restive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you will listen,&#8221; he said quietly; &#8220;you
shall hear every word. My father brought sheep
into the Peace River country. The cattlemen
picked on him to make an example of. He went
out, unarmed, one night to take care of the horses.
My mother heard two shots. He didn&#8217;t come
back. She went to look for him. He was lying
under the corral gate with a hole smashed
through his jaw by a rifle-bullet that tore his
head half off.&#8221; De Spain did not raise his voice
nor did he hasten his words. &#8220;I was born one
night six months after that,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;My
mother died that night. When a neighbor&#8217;s wife
took me from her arm and wrapped me in a
blanket, she saw I carried the face of my father
as my mother had seen it the night he was murdered.
That,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is what made me a
&#8216;gunman.&#8217; Not whiskey&ndash;&ndash;not women&ndash;&ndash;not cards&ndash;&ndash;just
what you&#8217;ve heard. And I&#8217;ll tell you
something else you may tell the men that call
me a gunman. The man that shot down my
father at his corral gate I haven&#8217;t found yet. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
expect to find him. For ten years I&#8217;ve been
getting ready to find him. He is here&ndash;&ndash;in these
mountains. I don&#8217;t even know his name. But
if I live, I&#8217;ll find him. And when I do, I&#8217;ll tear
open his head with a soft bullet in the way he tore
my father&#8217;s open. After I get through with that
man&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;he hesitated&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;they may call me whatever
they like.&#8221;</p>
<p>The faint ghostliness of the coming day, writing
its warning in the eastern sky, the bitter chill
of the dying night, the slow, hard, impassive utterance,
the darkness in which she stood listening
to an enemy she could not see, the loneliness and
danger of her situation combined to impress on
the unwilling listener the picture of the murder,
the tragic birth, and the mother&#8217;s death. &#8220;You
want me out of the Gap,&#8221; de Spain concluded,
his voice unchanged. &#8220;I want to get out. Come
back, once more, in the daytime. I will see
what I can do with my foot by that time.&#8221; He
paused. &#8220;Will you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated. &#8220;It would be too dangerous
for me to come up here in the daytime. Trouble
would follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come at dusk. You know I am no murderer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know it,&#8221; she persisted stubbornly.
It was her final protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Count, some day, on knowing it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>CROSSING A DEEP RIVER</h3>
</div>
<p>A grizzly bear hidden among the haystacks
back of the corral would have given
Nan much less anxiety than de Spain secreted
in the heart of the Morgan stronghold. But as
she hurried home, fearful of encountering an early
rider who should ask questions, it seemed as if
she might, indeed, find some way of getting rid
of the troublesome foe without having it on her
conscience that she had starved a wounded man
to death, or that he had shot some one of her
people in getting away.</p>
<p>Her troubled speculations were reduced now
almost to wondering when de Spain would leave,
and, disinclined though she felt to further parley,
she believed he would go the sooner if she were
to consent to see him again. Everything he had
said to her seemed to unsettle her mind and to
imperil impressions concerning him that she felt
it dangerous, or at least treasonable, to part with.
To believe anything but the worst of a man whom
she heard cursed and abused continually by her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
uncles, cousins, and their associates and retainers,
seemed a monstrous thing&ndash;&ndash;and every effort
de Spain made to dislodge her prejudices called
for fresh distrust on her part. What had most
shaken her convictions&ndash;&ndash;and it would come back
to her in spite of everything she could do to
keep it out of her mind&ndash;&ndash;was the recollection of
the murder of his father, the tragic death of his
mother. As for the facts of his story, somehow
she never thought of questioning them. The seal
of its dreadful truth he carried on his face.</p>
<p>That day Nan washed her hair. On the second
day&ndash;&ndash;because there were no good reasons for it&ndash;&ndash;she
found herself deciding conscientiously to
see de Spain for the last time, and toward sunset.
This was about the time he had suggested, but it
really seemed, after long thought, the best time.
She began dressing early for her trip, and with
constantly recurring dissatisfaction with her wardrobe&ndash;&ndash;picking
the best of her limited stock of
silk stockings, choosing the freshest of her few
pairs of tan boots. All of her riding-skirts looked
shabby as she fretfully inspected them; but
Bonita pressed out the newest one for the hurried
occasion, while Nan used the interval, with more
than usual care, on her troublesome hair&ndash;&ndash;never
less tractable, it seemed, in her life. Nothing, in
truth, in her appearance, satisfied her, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
was obliged at last to turn from her glass with
the hateful sigh that it made no difference anyway.</p>
<p>De Spain was sitting with his back against a
rock, and his knees drawn up, leaning his head
on his right hand and resting his elbow on the
knee. His left arm hung down over his left knee,
and the look on his face was one of reflection and
irresolution rather than of action and decision.
But he looked so restored after his brief period
of nourishment that Nan, when she stepped up
on the ledge at sunset, would not have known
the wreck she had seen in the same place the week
before.</p>
<p>His heart jumped at the sight of her young
face, and her clear, courageous eyes surveyed
him questioningly as he scrambled to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to tramp out of here to-morrow
night,&#8221; he confided to her after his thanks. &#8220;It
is Saturday; a lot of your men will be in Sleepy
Cat&ndash;&ndash;and they won&#8217;t all be very keen-sighted on
their way back. I can get a good start outside
before daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>She heard him with relief. &#8220;What will you do
then?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hide. Watch every chance to crawl a mile
nearer Calabasas. I can&#8217;t walk much, but I
ought to make it by Sunday night or Monday
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
morning. I may see a friend&ndash;&ndash;perhaps I may see
the other fellow&#8217;s friend, and with my lone cartridge
I may be able to bluff him out of a horse,&#8221;
he suggested, gazing at the crimson tie that
flowed from Nan&#8217;s open neck. &#8220;By the way,&#8221;
he added, his glance resting on her right side as
he noticed the absence of her holster, &#8220;where is
your protector to-day?&#8221; She made no answer.
&#8220;Fine form,&#8221; he said coldly, &#8220;to come unarmed
on an errand of mercy to a desperado.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan flushed with vexation. &#8220;I came away in
such a hurry I forgot it,&#8221; she replied lamely.</p>
<p>&#8220;A forget might cost you your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;ve forgotten you left a cartridge-belt
behind once yourself,&#8221; she returned swiftly.
The retort startled him. How could she know?
But he would not, at first, ask a question, though
her eyes told him she knew what she was talking
about. They looked at each other a moment in
silence.</p>
<p>De Spain, convicted, finally laid his fingers
over the butt of his empty revolver. &#8220;How did
you find that out?&#8221;</p>
<p>She tossed her head. They were standing only
a few feet apart, de Spain supporting himself now
with his left hand high up against the wall; Nan,
with her shoulder lightly against it; both had become
quizzical. &#8220;Other people forget, too, then,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
was all she said, fingering the loosened tie as
the breeze from the west blew it toward her
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t forget; not that
time. I went over to the joint to get a cup of
coffee and expected to be back within five minutes,
never dreaming of walking into a bear
trap.&#8221; He drew his revolver and, breaking it
negligently, took out the single cartridge. &#8220;Take
this.&#8221; He held the cartridge in his left hand and
took two halting steps toward her&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;since you
are unarmed, I will be, too. Not that this puts
us on an even footing. I don&#8217;t mean that.
Nothing would. You would be too much for me
in any kind of a contest, armed or unarmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded to hide
her confusion. And she saw that each step he
took cost pain, skilfully concealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are to take this cartridge
as a remembrance of my forgetfulness and
your adventure.&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew back. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was persistent. She allowed him to drop
the loaded shell into her hand. &#8220;Now,&#8221; he continued,
replacing his gun, &#8220;if I encounter any of
your people in an attempt to break through a
line, and somebody gets killed, you will know,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
when you hear the story, that <i>this</i> time, at least,
<i>I</i> didn&#8217;t &#8216;start it.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the same&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She hesitated. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think that&#8217;s exactly right. You need not shoot
my people, even if you meet them. There are
plenty of others you might meet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He put her objections aside, enjoying being so
near her and happy that she made no retreat.
&#8220;My reputation,&#8221; he insisted, &#8220;has suffered a
little in Morgan&#8217;s Gap. I mean that at least one
who makes her home under Music Mountain
shall know differently of me. What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
He heard a sound. &#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two, looking at each other, strained their
ears to hear more through the rush of the falling
water. &#8220;Some one is coming,&#8221; said de Spain.
Nan ran lightly to where she could peep over the
ledge. Hardly pausing as she glanced down, she
stepped quickly back. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go right on up the
mountain to the azalea fields,&#8221; she said hastily.</p>
<p>He nodded. &#8220;I&#8217;ll hide. Stop. If you are
questioned, you don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m here. You must
say so for your own sake, not for mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was gone before he had finished. De Spain
drew quickly back to where he could secrete
himself. In another moment he heard heavy
footsteps where he had stood with his visitor.
But the footsteps crossed the ledge, and their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
sound died away up the path Nan had taken.
De Spain could not see the intruder. It was
impossible to conjecture who he was or what
his errand, and de Spain could only await whatever
should develop. He waited several minutes
before he heard any sign of life above. Then
snatches of two voices began to reach him. He
could distinguish Nan&#8217;s voice and at intervals
the heavier tones of a man. The two were descending.
In a few moments they reached the
ledge, and de Spain, near at hand, could hear
every word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on a minute,&#8221; said the man roughly.
His voice was heavy and his utterance harsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must get home,&#8221; objected Nan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, I tell you,&#8221; returned her companion.
De Spain could not see, but he began already to
feel the scene. &#8220;I want to talk to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can talk going down,&#8221; parried Nan.</p>
<p>De Spain heard her hurried footfalls. &#8220;No,
you don&#8217;t,&#8221; retorted her companion, evidently
cutting off her retreat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gale Morgan!&#8221; There was a blaze in Nan&#8217;s
sharp exclamation. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean you and I are going to have this out
right here, before we leave this ledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, I want to go home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go home when I say so.&#8221;</p>

<p class='caption'>
&#8220;Stand away from that girl!&#8221; repeated de Spain harshly, backing the words with a step forward.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How dare you stop me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you what I dare, young lady. You&#8217;ve
been backing and filling with me for two years.
Now I want to know what you&#8217;re going to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gale! Won&#8217;t you have a little sense? Come
along home with me, like a good fellow, and I&#8217;ll
talk things over with you just as long as you
like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll talk things over with me right here,
and as long as <i>I</i> like,&#8221; he retorted savagely.
&#8220;Every time I ask you to marry me you&#8217;ve got
some new excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s shameful for you to act in this way,
Gale.&#8221; She spoke low and rapidly to her enraged
suitor. De Spain alone knew it was to
keep her humiliation from his own ears, and he
made no effort to follow her quick, pleading words.
The moment was most embarrassing for two of
the three involved. But nothing that Nan could
say would win from her cousin any reprieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you came back from school I told
Duke I was going to marry you. He said, all
right,&#8221; persisted her cousin stubbornly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gale Morgan, what Uncle Duke said, or didn&#8217;t
say, has nothing whatever to do with <i>my</i> consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I was going to marry you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that bind me to get married, when I
don&#8217;t want to?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You said you&#8217;d marry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan exploded: &#8220;I never, never said so in this
world.&#8221; Her voice shook with indignation.
&#8220;You know that&#8217;s a downright falsehood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you didn&#8217;t care for anybody else,&#8221; he
fairly bellowed. &#8220;Now I want to know whether
you&#8217;ll marry me if I take you over to Sleepy Cat
to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; Nan flung out her answer, reckless of
consequence. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never marry you. Let me go
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go home when I get through with you.
You&#8217;ve fooled me long enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her blood froze at the look in his face. &#8220;How
dare you!&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Get out of my way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You damned little vixen!&#8221; He sprang forward
and caught her by the wrist. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take the
kinks out of you. You wouldn&#8217;t marry me your
way, now you&#8217;ll marry me mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>She fought like a tigress. He dragged her
struggling into his arms. But above her half-stifled
cries and his grunting laugh, Morgan heard
a sharp voice: &#8220;Take your hands off that girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whirling, with Nan in his savage arms, the
half-drunken mountaineer saw de Spain ten feet
away, his right hand resting on the grip of his
revolver. Stunned, but sobered by mortal danger,
Morgan greeted his enemy with an oath.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
&#8220;Stand away from that girl!&#8221; repeated de Spain
harshly, backing the words with a step forward.
Morgan&#8217;s grasp relaxed. Nan, jerking away,
looked at de Spain and instantly stepped in front
of her cousin, on whom de Spain seemed about to
draw.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; demanded Morgan,
with an enraged oath.</p>
<p>&#8220;I left some business with you the other day
at Calabasas half finished,&#8221; said de Spain. &#8220;I&#8217;m
here this afternoon to clean it up. Get away
from that girl!&#8221;</p>
<p>His manner frightened even Nan. The quick
step to the side and back&ndash;&ndash;poising himself like a
fencer&ndash;&ndash;his revolver restrained a moment in its
sheath by an eager right arm, as if at any instant
it might leap into deadly play.</p>
<p>Shocked with new fear, Nan hesitated. If it
was play, it was too realistic for the nerves even
of a mountain girl. De Spain&#8217;s angry face and
burning eyes photographed themselves on her
memory from that moment. But whatever he
meant, she had her part to do. She backed, with
arms spread low at her sides, directly against her
cousin. &#8220;You shan&#8217;t fight,&#8221; she cried at de
Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand away from that man!&#8221; retorted de
Spain sternly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You shan&#8217;t kill my cousin. What do you
mean? What are you doing here? Leave us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get away, Nan, I tell you. I&#8217;ll finish him,&#8221;
cried Morgan, puncturing every word with an oath.</p>
<p>She whirled and caught her cousin in her arms.
&#8220;He will shoot us both if you fire. Take me away,
Gale. You coward,&#8221; she exclaimed, whirling
again with trembling tones on de Spain, &#8220;would
you kill a woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain saw the danger was past. It needed
hardly an instant to show him that Morgan had
lost stomach for a fight. He talked wrathfully,
but he made no motion to draw. &#8220;I see I&#8217;ve got
to chase you into a fight,&#8221; said de Spain contemptuously,
and starting gingerly to circle the
hesitating cousin. Nan, in her excitement, ran
directly toward the enemy, as if to cut off his
movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare put me in danger,&#8221; she cried,
facing de Spain threateningly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare
fight my cousin here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand away from me,&#8221; hammered de Spain,
eying Morgan steadily.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is wounded now,&#8221; stormed Nan, so fast
she could hardly frame the words. &#8220;You shan&#8217;t
kill him. If you are a man, don&#8217;t shoot a wounded
man and a woman. You shan&#8217;t shoot. Gale!
protect yourself!&#8221; Whirling to face her cousin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
she took the chance to back directly against de
Spain. Both hands were spread open and partly
behind her, the palms up, as if to check him. In
the instant that she and de Spain were in contact
he realized, rather than saw&ndash;&ndash;for his eyes
never released Morgan&#8217;s eyes&ndash;&ndash;what she was frantically
slipping to him&ndash;&ndash;the loaded cartridge. It
was done in a flash, and she was running from
him again. Her warm fingers had swept across
his own. She had returned to him, voluntarily,
his slender chance for life. But in doing it she
had challenged him to a new and overwhelming
interest in life itself. And again, in front of her
cousin, she was crying out anew against the shedding
of blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came up here to fight a man. I don&#8217;t fight
women,&#8221; muttered de Spain, maintaining the deceit
and regarding both with an unpromising visage.
Then to Morgan. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to you later.
But you&#8217;ve got to fight or get away from here,
both of you, in ten seconds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me away, Gale,&#8221; cried Nan. &#8220;Leave
him here&ndash;&ndash;take me home! Take me home!&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught her cousin&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Stay right
where you are,&#8221; shouted Morgan, pointing at de
Spain, and following Nan as she pulled him along.
&#8220;When I come back, I&#8217;ll give you what you&#8217;re
looking for.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Bring your friends,&#8221; said de Spain tauntingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll accommodate four more of you. Stop!&#8221;
With one hand still on his revolver he pointed the
way. &#8220;Go down that trail first, Morgan. Stay
where you are, girl, till he gets down that hill.
You won&#8217;t pot me over her shoulder for a while
yet. Move!&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan took the path sullenly, de Spain covering
every step he took. Behind de Spain Nan
stood waiting for her cousin to get beyond earshot.
&#8220;What,&#8221; she whispered hurriedly to de
Spain, &#8220;will you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Covering Morgan, who could whirl on him at
any turn in the descent, de Spain could not look
at her in answering. &#8220;Looks pretty rocky,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will start the whole Gap as soon as he
gets to his horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at the darkening sky. &#8220;They won&#8217;t
be very active on the job before morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan was at a safe distance. De Spain
turned to Nan. He tried to speak out to her,
but she sternly smothered his every effort. Her
cheeks were on fire, she breathed fast, her eyes
burned.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks,&#8221; muttered de Spain, &#8220;as if I should
have to climb Music Mountain to make a get-away.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There is no good place to hide anywhere
above here,&#8221; said Nan, regarding him intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why look so hard at me, then?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;If this is the last of it, I can take it here with
our one lone cartridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were bent on him as if they would
pierce him through. &#8220;If I save your life&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; still
breathing fast, she hesitated for words&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;you
won&#8217;t trick me&ndash;&ndash;ever&ndash;&ndash;will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Steadily returning her appealing gaze, de Spain
answered with deliberation. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ever give
me a chance to trick you, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; she demanded, fear and
distrust burning in her tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;My life,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;isn&#8217;t worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He could see her resolute underlip,
pink with fresh young blood, quiver with
intensity of feeling as she faltered. &#8220;You know
what every man says of every girl&ndash;&ndash;foolish, trusting,
easy to deceive&ndash;&ndash;everything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May God wither my tongue before ever it
speaks to deceive <i>you</i>, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A while ago you frightened me so&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frightened you! Great God!&#8221; He stepped
closer and looked straight down into her eyes.
&#8220;If you had raised just one finger when I was
bluffing that fellow, I&#8217;d have calmed down and
eaten out of your little hand, by the hour!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not a moment to lose,&#8221; she said
swiftly. &#8220;Listen: a trail around this mountain
leads out of the Gap, straight across the face of
El Capitan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen! It is terribly dangerous&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever it is it&#8217;s a concrete boulevard to a
man in my fix.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is half a mile&ndash;&ndash;only inches wide in places&ndash;&ndash;up
and down&ndash;&ndash;loose rock&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some trail!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you slip it&#8217;s a thousand feet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred would be more than plenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A good climber can do it&ndash;&ndash;I have done it.
I&#8217;d even go with you, if I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head angrily at what he dared
show in his eyes. &#8220;Oh, keep still, listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;d go, Nan,&#8221; he declared unperturbed.
&#8220;But believe me, I never would let you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go, because to do any good I must
meet you with a horse outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>He only looked silently at her, and she turned her
eyes from his gaze. &#8220;See,&#8221; she said, taking him
eagerly to the back of the ledge and pointing,
&#8220;follow that trail, the one to the east&ndash;&ndash;you can&#8217;t
get lost; you can reach El Capitan before dark&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
very close. Creep carefully across El Capitan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
on that narrow trail, and on the other side there
is a wide one clear down to the road&ndash;&ndash;oh, do be
careful on El Capitan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must watch my chance to get away from the
corral with a horse. If I fail it will be because I
am locked up at home, and you must hide and
do the best you can. How much they will surmise
of this, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go now, this minute,&#8221; he said, restraining his
words. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t come, I shall know why.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned without speaking and, fearless as a
chamois, ran down the rocks. De Spain, losing
not a moment, hobbled rapidly up along the
granite-walled passage that led the way to his
chance for life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A VENTURE IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>
<p>Pushing his way hastily forward when he
could make haste; crawling slowly on his
hands and knees when held by opposing rock;
feeling for narrow footholds among loose and
treacherous fragments; flattening himself like a
leech against the face of the precipice when the
narrowing ledge left him only inches under foot;
clinging with torn hands to every favoring crevice,
and pausing when the peril was extreme for
fresh strength, de Spain dragged his injured foot
across the sheer face of El Capitan in the last
shadows of the day&#8217;s failing light.</p>
<p>Half-way across, he stopped to look down. Far
below lay the valley shrouded in night. Where he
stood, stars, already bright, lighted the peaks.
But nowhere in the depths could he see any sign
of life. Spent by his effort, de Spain reached the
rendezvous Nan had indicated, as nearly as the
stars would tell him, by ten o&#8217;clock. He fell
asleep in the aspen grove. Horsemen passing not
a hundred yards away roused him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>He could not tell how many or who they were,
but from the sounds he judged they were riding
into the Gap. The moon was not yet up, so he
knew it was not much after midnight. The
ground was very cold, and he crawled farther on
toward the road along which Nan had said he
might look for her. It was only after a long and
doubtful hour that he heard the muffled footfalls
of a horse. He stood concealed among the smaller
trees until he could distinguish the outlines of
the animal, and his eye caught the figure of the
rider.</p>
<p>De Spain stepped out of the trees, and, moving
toward Nan, caught her hand and helped her to
the ground.</p>
<p>She enjoined silence, and led the horse into the
little grove. Stopping well within it, she stooped
and began rearranging the mufflers on the hoofs.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m too late,&#8221; she said. &#8220;How
long have you been here?&#8221; She faced de Spain
with one hand on the pony&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you get here at all?&#8221; he asked,
reaching clandestinely for her other hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got terribly frightened thinking of your trying
El Capitan. Did you have any falls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see I&#8217;m here&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve even slept since.
You! How could you get here at all with a
horse?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m only not too late,&#8221; she murmured,
drawing her hand away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve loads of time, it&#8217;s not one o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are hiding on both trails outside watching
for you&ndash;&ndash;and the moon will be up&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; She
seemed very anxious. De Spain made light of
her fears. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get past them&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve got to, Nan.
Don&#8217;t give it a thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every corner is watched,&#8221; she repeated
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I tell you I&#8217;ll dodge them, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They have rifles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t get a chance to use them on
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;ll think of me&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He
heard the troubled note in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>She began to unbutton her jacket. Throwing
back the revers she felt inside around her waist,
unfastened after a moment and drew forth a
leathern strap. She laid it in de Spain&#8217;s hands.
&#8220;This is yours,&#8221; she said in a whisper.</p>
<p>He felt it questioningly, hurriedly, then with
amazement. &#8220;Not a cartridge-belt!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221; She made no answer. &#8220;Where
did you get it, Nan?&#8221; he whispered hurriedly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Where you left it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; She was silent. &#8220;When?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been to Calabasas and back to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody but Sassoon is in the chase,&#8221; she
replied uneasily&ndash;&ndash;as if not knowing what to say,
or how to say it. &#8220;They said you should never
leave the Gap alive&ndash;&ndash;they are ready with traps
everywhere. I didn&#8217;t know what to do. I
couldn&#8217;t bear&ndash;&ndash;after what&ndash;&ndash;you did for me to-night&ndash;&ndash;to
think of your being shot down like a
dog, when you were only trying to get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have had you take a ride like that
for forty belts!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McAlpin showed it to me the last time I was
at the stage barn, hanging where you left it.&#8221;
He strapped the cartridges around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should never have taken that ride for
it. But since you have&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; He had drawn his
revolver from his waistband. He broke it now
and held it out. &#8220;Load it for me, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put four more cartridges in it yourself. Except
for your cartridge, the gun is empty. When
you do that you will know none of them ever will
be used against your own except to protect my
life. And if you have any among them whose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
life ought to come ahead of mine&ndash;&ndash;name him, or
them, now. Do as I tell you&ndash;&ndash;load the gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took hold of her hands and, in spite of her
refusals, made her do his will. He guided her
hand to draw the cartridges, one after another,
from his belt, and waited for her to slip them in
the darkness into the empty cylinder, to close the
breech, and hand the gun back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Nan,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you know me. You
may yet have doubts&ndash;&ndash;they will all die. You will
hear many stories about me&ndash;&ndash;but you will say:
&#8216;I put the cartridges in his revolver with my own
hands, and I know he won&#8217;t abuse the means of
defense I gave him myself.&#8217; There can never be
any real doubts or misunderstandings between us
again, Nan, if you&#8217;ll forgive me for making a fool
of myself when I met you at Tenison&#8217;s. I didn&#8217;t
dream you were desperate about the way your
uncle was playing; I pieced it all together afterward.&#8221;
He waited for her to speak, but she remained
silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have given me my life, my defense,&#8221; he
continued, passing from a subject that he perceived
was better left untouched. &#8220;Who is
nearest and dearest to you at home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My Uncle Duke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I never will raise a hand against your
Uncle Duke. And this man, to-night&ndash;&ndash;this cousin&ndash;&ndash;Gale?
Nan, what is that man?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I hate him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God! So do I!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he is a cousin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I suppose he must be one of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he tries to kill you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t be very long in trying that. And
now, what about yourself? What have you got
to defend yourself against him, and against every
other drunken man?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laid her own pistol without a word in de
Spain&#8217;s hand. He felt it, opened, closed, and
gave it back. &#8220;That&#8217;s a good defender&ndash;&ndash;when
it&#8217;s in reach. When it&#8217;s at home it&#8217;s a poor one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will never be at home again except when I
am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you a secret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Nan unsuspectingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are engaged to be married.&#8221; She sprang
from him like a deer. &#8220;It&#8217;s a dead secret,&#8221; he
said gravely; &#8220;nobody knows it yet&ndash;&ndash;not even
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need never talk again like that if you
want to be friends with me,&#8221; she said indignantly.
&#8220;I hate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate it if you will; it&#8217;s so. And it began
when you handed me that little bit of lead and
brass on the mountain to-night, to defend your
life and mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hate you if you persecute me the way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
Gale does. The moon is almost up. You must
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you on your feet, Nan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Moccasins.&#8221; He stooped down and felt one
with his hand. She drew her foot hastily away.
&#8220;What a girl to manage!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going home,&#8221; she said with decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t for a minute yet, Nan,&#8221; he pleaded.
&#8220;Think how long it will be before I can ever see
you again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may never see anybody again if you don&#8217;t
realize your danger to-night. Can you ride with
a hackamore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t dare bring anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told me,&#8221; he persisted, &#8220;how
you got away at all.&#8221; They had walked out of the
trees. He looked reluctantly to the east. &#8220;Tell
me and I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he promised.</p>
<p>&#8220;After I went up to my room I waited till
the house was all quiet. Then I started for Calabasas.
When I came back I got up to my room
without being seen, and sat at the window a long
time. I waited till all the men stopped riding
past. Then I climbed through the window and
down the kitchen roof, and let myself down to
the ground. Some more men came past, and I
hid on the porch and slipped over to the horse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
barns and found a hackamore, and went down to
the corral and hunted around till I found this
little pinto&ndash;&ndash;she&#8217;s the best to ride bareback.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could ride a razorback&ndash;&ndash;why take all that
trouble for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t start while you have a chance,
you undo everything I have tried to do to avoid
a fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wind, stirring softly, set the aspen leaves
quivering. The stars, chilled in the thin, clear
night air, hung diamond-like in the heavens and
the eastern sky across the distant desert paled
for the rising moon. The two standing at the
horse&#8217;s head listened a moment together in the
darkness. De Spain, leaning forward, said something
in a low, laughing voice. Nan made no
answer. Then, bending, he took her hand and,
before she could release it, caught it up to his
lips.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>For a long time after he had gone she stood,
listening for a shot&ndash;&ndash;wondering, breathless at
moments, whether de Spain could get past the
waiting traps. The moon came up, and still
lingering, torn with suspense, she watched a drift
of fleecy clouds darken it. She scanned anxiously
the wrinkled face of the desert which, with a
woman&#8217;s craft, hides at night the accidents of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
age. It seemed to Nan as if she could overlook
every foot of the motionless sea for miles before
her; but she well knew how much it could conceal
of ambush and death even when it professed
so fairly to reveal all. Strain her ears as she
would, the desert gave back no ripple of sound.
No shot echoed from its sinister recesses&ndash;&ndash;not even
the clatter of retreating hoofs.</p>
<p>De Spain, true to all she had ever heard of his
Indian-like stealth, had left her side unabashed
and unafraid&ndash;&ndash;living, laughing, paying bold court
to her even when she stubbornly refused to be
courted&ndash;&ndash;and had made himself in the twinkling
of an eye a part of the silence beyond&ndash;&ndash;the silence
of the night, the wind, the stars, the waste of sand,
and of all the mystery that brooded upon it. She
would have welcomed, in her keen suspense, a
sound of some kind, some reminder that he yet
lived and could yet laugh; none came.</p>
<p>When it seemed as if an hour must have passed
Nan felt her way noiselessly home. She regained
her room as she had left it, through her east window,
and, throwing herself across her bed, fell
into a heavy sleep.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Day was breaking when the night boss, standing
in the doorway at the Calabasas barns, saw a
horseman riding at a leisurely pace up the Thief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
River road. The barnman scrutinized the approaching
stranger closely. There was something
strange and something familiar in the outlines of
the figure. But when the night-rider had dismounted
in front of the barn door, turned his
horse loose, and, limping stiffly, walked forward
on foot, the man rubbed his eyes hard before he
could believe them. Then he uttered an incredulous
greeting and led Henry de Spain into the
barn office.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s friends of yours in your room up-stairs
right now,&#8221; he declared, bulging with
shock. De Spain, sitting down, forbade the barnman
to disturb them, only asking who they were.</p>
<p>When he had asked half a dozen more leisurely
questions and avoided answering twice as many,
the barnman at de Spain&#8217;s request helped him
up-stairs. Beside himself with excitement, the
night boss turned, grinning, as he laid one hand
on the door-knob and the other on de Spain&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have come,&#8221; he whispered loudly,
&#8220;at a better time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entryway was dark, and from the silence
within the room one might have thought its occupants,
if there were such, wrapped in slumber.
But at intervals a faint clicking sound could be
heard. The night man threw open the door. By
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
the light of two stage dash-lamps, one set on the
dresser and the other on a window-ledge, four
men sat about a rickety table in a life-and-death
struggle at cards. No voice broke the tense silence,
not even when the door was thrown broadly
open.</p>
<p>No one&ndash;&ndash;neither Lefever, Scott, Frank Elpaso,
nor McAlpin&ndash;&ndash;looked up when de Spain walked
into the room and, with the night man tiptoeing
behind, advanced composedly toward the group.
Even then his presence would have passed unnoticed,
but that Bob Scott&#8217;s ear mechanically recorded
the limping step and transmitted to his
trained intelligence merely notice of something
unusual.</p>
<p>Scott, picking up his cards one at a time as
Lefever dealt, raised his eyes. Startling as the
sight of the man given up for dead must have
been, no muscle of Bob Scott&#8217;s body moved. His
expression of surprise slowly dissolved into a grin
that mutely invited the others, as he had found
out for himself, to find out for themselves.</p>
<p>Lefever finished his deal, threw down the pack,
and picked up his hand. His suspicious eyes
never rose above the level of the faces at the
table; but when he had thumbed his cards and
looked from one to the other of the remaining
players to read the weather-signals, he perceived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
on Scott&#8217;s face an unwonted expression, and looked
to where the scout&#8217;s gaze was turned for an explanation
of it. Lefever&#8217;s own eyes at the sight
of the thinned, familiar face behind Elpaso&#8217;s
chair, starting, opened like full moons. The big
fellow spread one hand out, his cards hidden within
it, and with the other hand prudently drew down
his pile of chips. &#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said lightly,
&#8220;this game is interned.&#8221; He rose and put a
silent hand across the table over Elpaso&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;Henry,&#8221; he exclaimed impassively, &#8220;one
question, if you please&ndash;&ndash;and only one: How in
thunder did you do it?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>STRATEGY</h3>
</div>
<p>One week went to repairs. To a man of action
such a week is longer than ten years of
service. But chained to a bed in the Sleepy Cat
hospital, de Spain had no escape from one week
of thinking, and for that week he thought about
Nan Morgan.</p>
<p>He rebelled at the situation that had placed
him at enmity with her kinsfolk, yet he realized
there was no help for this. The Morgans were
a law unto themselves. Hardened men with a
hardened code, they lived in their fastness like
Ishmaelites. Counselled by their leader, old Duke
Morgan, brains of the clan and influential enough
to keep outside the penalties of the law themselves,
their understanding with the outlaws of
the Sinks was apparently complete, and the hospitality
of one or another of their following within
the Gap afforded a refuge for practically any
mountain criminal.</p>
<p>But none of these reflections lightened de
Spain&#8217;s burden of discontent. One thought alone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
possessed him&ndash;&ndash;Nan; her comely body, which he
worshipped to the tips of her graceful fingers;
her alert mind, which he saw reflected in the
simplest thought she expressed; her mobile lips,
which he followed to the least sound they gave
forth! The longer he pictured her, figured as she
had appeared to him like a phantom on Music
Mountain, the more he longed to be back at the
foot of it, wounded again and famished. And the
impulse that moved him the first moment he
could get out of bed and into a saddle was to
spur his way hard and fast to her; to make her,
against a score of burly cousins, his own; and
never to release her from his sudden arms again.</p>
<p>With de Spain, to think was to do; at least to do
something, but not without further careful thinking,
and not without anticipating every chance of
failure. And his manner was to cast up all difficulties
and obstacles in a situation, brush them
aside, and have his will if the heavens fell. Such
a temperament he had inherited from his father&#8217;s
fiery heart and his mother&#8217;s suffering, close-set
lips as he had remembered them in the little pictures
of her; and he now set himself, while doing
his routine work every day, to do one particular
thing&ndash;&ndash;to see, talk to, plead with, struggle with
the woman, or girl, rather&ndash;&ndash;child even, to his
thoughts, so fragile she was&ndash;&ndash;this girl who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
given him back his life against her own marauding
relatives.</p>
<p>For many days Nan seemed a match for all
the wiles de Spain could use to catch sight of
her. He spent his days riding up and down the
line on horseback; driving behind his team; on
the stages; in and out of the streets of Sleepy Cat&ndash;&ndash;nominally
looking for stock, for equipment, for
supplies, or frankly for nothing&ndash;&ndash;but always looking
for Nan.</p>
<p>His friends saw that something was absorbing
him in an unusual, even an extraordinary way, yet
none could arrive at a certain conclusion as to
what it was. When Scott in secret conference
was appealed to by Jeffries, he smiled foolishly,
at a loss, and shook his head.</p>
<p>Lefever argued with less reticence. &#8220;It stands
to reason, Jeffries. A man that went through
that ten minutes at Calabasas would naturally
think a good deal about what he is getting out of
his job, and what his future chances are for being
promoted any minute, day or night, by a forty-five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps his salary had better be raised,&#8221; conceded
Jeffries reflectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I figure,&#8221; pursued Lefever, &#8220;that he has already
saved the company fifty thousands in depredations
during the next year or two. The Calabasas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
gang is busted for five years&ndash;&ndash;they would
eat out of his hand&ndash;&ndash;isn&#8217;t that so, Bob?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Calabasas gang, yes; not the Morgans.&#8221;</p>
<p>John&#8217;s eyes opened on Scott with that solemnity
he could assume to bolster a baldly unconvincing
statement. &#8220;Not now, Bob. Not now,
I admit; but they will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott only smiled. &#8220;What do you make out of
the way he acts?&#8221; persisted Lefever, resenting
his companion&#8217;s incredulity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make anything of it,&#8221; premised Bob,
&#8220;except that he has something on his mind. If
you&#8217;ll tell me what happened from the time he
jumped through the window at Calabasas till he
walked into his room that night at the barn, I&#8217;ll
tell you what he&#8217;s thinking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, what happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry left some things out of his story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard him tell it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeffries, acting without delay on the suspicion
that de Spain was getting ready to resign, raised
his salary. To his surprise, de Spain told him that
the company was already paying him more than
he was worth and declined the raise; yet he took
nobody whomsoever into his confidence.</p>
<p>However, the scent of something concealed in
de Spain&#8217;s story had long before touched Lefever&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
own nostrils, and he was stimulated by
mere pride to run the secret down. Accordingly,
he set himself to find, in a decent way, something
in the nature of an explanation.</p>
<p>De Spain, in the interval, made no progress in
his endeavor to see Nan. The one man in the
country who could have surmised the situation
between the two&ndash;&ndash;the barn boss, McAlpin&ndash;&ndash;if he
entertained suspicions, was far too pawky to
share them with any one.</p>
<p>When two weeks had passed without de Spain&#8217;s
having seen Nan or having heard of her being
seen, the conclusion urged itself on him that she
was either ill or in trouble&ndash;&ndash;perhaps in trouble
for helping him; a moment later he was laying
plans to get into the Gap to find out.</p>
<p>Nothing in the way of a venture could be more
foolhardy&ndash;&ndash;this he admitted to himself&ndash;&ndash;nothing,
he consoled himself by reflecting, but something
stronger than danger could justify it. Of all the
motley Morgan following within the mountain
fastness he could count on but one man to help
him in the slightest degree&ndash;&ndash;this was the derelict,
Bull Page. There was no choice but to use him,
and he was easily enlisted, for the Calabasas affair
had made a heroic figure of de Spain in the barrooms.
De Spain, accordingly, lay in wait for
the old man and intercepted him one day on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
the road to Sleepy Cat, walking the twenty miles
patiently for his whiskey.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be the only man in the Gap, Bull,
that can&#8217;t borrow or steal a horse to ride,&#8221; remarked
de Spain, stopping him near the river
bridge.</p>
<p>Page pushed back the broken brim of his hat
and looked up. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; he
said, imparting a cheerful confidence, &#8220;but ten
years ago I had horses to lend to every man &#8217;tween
here and Thief River.&#8221; He nodded toward Sleepy
Cat with a wrecked smile, and by a dramatic
chance the broken hat brim fell with the words:
&#8220;They&#8217;ve got &#8217;em all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your fault, Bull.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; Up went the broken brim, and the
whiskied face lighted with a shaking smile, &#8220;you
turned some trick on that Calabasas crew&ndash;&ndash;some
fight,&#8221; Bull chuckled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bull, is old Duke Morgan a Republican?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull looked surprised at the turn of de Spain&#8217;s
question, but answered in good faith: &#8220;Duke
votes &#8217;most any ticket that&#8217;s agin the railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about picking a couple of good barnmen
over in the Gap, Bull?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of a job y&#8217;got?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See McAlpin the next time you&#8217;re over at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
Calabasas. How about that girl that lives with
Duke?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull&#8217;s face lighted. &#8220;Nan! Say! she&#8217;s a little
hummer!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear she&#8217;s gone down to Thief River teaching
school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Came by Duke&#8217;s less&#8217;n three hours ago. Seen
her in the kitchen makin&#8217; bread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re looking for a school-teacher down
there, anyway. Much sickness in the Gap lately,
Bull?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On&#8217;y sickness I knowed lately is what you&#8217;re
responsible for y&#8217;self,&#8221; retorted Bull with a grin.
&#8220;Pity y&#8217; left over any chips at all from that Calabasas
job, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See McAlpin, Bull, next time you&#8217;re over Calabasas
way. Here&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;de Spain drew some currency
from his pocket and handed a bill to Page.
&#8220;Go get your hair cut. Don&#8217;t talk too much&ndash;&ndash;wear
your whiskers long and your tongue short.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right-o!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it from old Bull Page, he&#8217;s a world&#8217;s
wonder of a sucker, but he knows his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But remember this&ndash;&ndash;you don&#8217;t know me. If
anybody knows you for a friend of mine, you are
no good to me. See?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull was beyond expressing his comprehension
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
in words alone. He winked, nodded, and screwed
his face into a thousand wrinkles. De Spain,
wheeling, rode away, the old man blinking first
after him, and then at the money in his hand.
He didn&#8217;t profess to understand everything in the
high country, but he could still distinguish the
principal figures at the end of a bank-note. When
he tramped to Calabasas the next day to interview
McAlpin he received more advice, with a
strong burr, about keeping his own counsel, and
a little expense money to run him until an opening
presented itself on the pay-roll.</p>
<p>But long before Bull Page reached Calabasas
that day de Spain had acted. When he left
Bull at the bridge, he started for Calabasas,
took supper there, ordered a saddle-horse for one
o&#8217;clock in the morning, went to his room, slept
soundly and, shortly after he was called, started
for Music Mountain. He walked his horse into
the Gap and rode straight for Duke Morgan&#8217;s
fortress. Leaving the horse under a heavy mountain-pine
close to the road, de Spain walked carefully
but directly around the house to the east
side. The sky was cloudy and the darkness almost
complete. He made his way as close as he
could to Nan&#8217;s window, and raised the soft, crooning
note of the desert owl.</p>
<p>After a while he was able to distinguish the outline
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
of her casement, and, with much patience and
some little skill remaining from the boyhood days,
he kept up the faint call. Down at the big barn
the chained watch-dog tore himself with a fury of
barking at the intruder, but mountain-lions were
common in the Gap, and the noisy sentinel gained
no credit for his alarm. Indeed, when the dog
slackened his fierceness, de Spain threw a stone
over his way to encourage a fresh outburst. But
neither the guardian nor the intruder was able to
arouse any one within the house.</p>
<p>Undeterred by his failure, de Spain held his
ground as long as he dared. When daybreak
threatened, he withdrew. The following night he
was in the Gap earlier, and with renewed determination.
He tossed a pebble into Nan&#8217;s open
window and renewed his soft call. Soon, a light
flickered for an instant within the room and died
out. In the darkness following this, de Spain
thought he discerned a figure outlined at the
casement. Some minutes later a door opened
and closed. He repeated the cry of the owl, and
could hear a footstep; the next moment he whispered
her name as she stood before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you want?&#8221; she asked, so calmly
that it upset him. &#8220;Why do you come here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Where he stood he was afraid of the sound of
her voice, and afraid of his own. &#8220;To see you,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
he said, collecting himself. &#8220;Come over to the
pine-tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under its heavy branches where the darkness
was most intense, he told her why he had come&ndash;&ndash;because
he could not see her anywhere outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing to see me about,&#8221; she responded,
still calm. &#8220;I helped you because you
were wounded. I was glad to see you get away
without fighting&ndash;&ndash;I hate bloodshed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But put yourself in my place a little, won&#8217;t
you? After what you did for me, isn&#8217;t it natural
I should want to be sure you are well and not in
any trouble on my account?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be natural, but it isn&#8217;t necessary. I
am in no trouble. No one here knows I even
know you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me for coming, then. I couldn&#8217;t rest,
Nan, without knowing something. I was here
last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you were.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started. &#8220;You made no sign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I? I suspected it was you.
When you came again to-night I knew I should
have to speak to you&ndash;&ndash;at least, to ask you not to
come again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will be in and out of town sometimes,
won&#8217;t you, Nan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am, it will not be to talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>The words were spoken deliberately. De Spain
was silent for a moment. &#8220;Not even to speak to
me?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must know the position I am in,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;And what a position you place me in
if I am seen to speak to you. This is my home.
You are the enemy of my people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not because I want to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you can&#8217;t expect them not to resent any
acquaintance on my part with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused before continuing. &#8220;Do you count
Gale Morgan as one of your people?&#8221; he asked
evenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I must.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you ought to count all of
your friends, your well-wishers, those who would
defend you with their lives, among your people?&#8221;
She made no answer. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they the kind of
people,&#8221; he persisted, &#8220;you need when you are in
trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t remind me I should be grateful
to you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;For I am,&#8221; she continued, unmoved.
&#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame to accuse me in that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were thinking when you spoke of what
happened with Gale on Music Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wish to God you and I were on Music Mountain
again! I never lived or did anything worth
living for, till you came to me that day on Music
Mountain. It&#8217;s true I was thinking of what happened
when I spoke&ndash;&ndash;but not to remind you you
owed anything to me. You don&#8217;t; get that out
of your head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I spoke in the way I did because I wanted to
remind you of what might happen some time
when I&#8217;m not near.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t be caught off my guard again. I
know how to defend myself from a drunken
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>He could not restrain all the bitterness he felt.
&#8220;That man,&#8221; he said deliberately, &#8220;is more dangerous
sober than drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I can&#8217;t defend myself, my uncle will
defend me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask him to let me help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t need any help. And he would
never ask you, if he did. I can&#8217;t live at home and
know you; that is why I ask you not to come
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was silent. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, all things
considered,&#8221; she hesitated, as if not knowing how
easiest to put it, &#8220;you ought to be willing to shake
hands and say good-by?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why, if you wish it,&#8221; he answered, taken
aback. And he added more quietly, &#8220;yes, if you
say so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; he returned, pausing, &#8220;don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not willing to be fair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to be fair&ndash;&ndash;I don&#8217;t want to promise
more than human nature will stand for&ndash;&ndash;and then
break my word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not asking a whole lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a whole lot to you, I know. But do you
really mean that you don&#8217;t want me ever to
speak to you again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you must put it that way&ndash;&ndash;yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he took a long breath, &#8220;there is one
way to make sure of that. I&#8217;ll tell you honestly
I don&#8217;t want to stand in the way of such a wish,
if it&#8217;s really yours. As you have said, it isn&#8217;t fair,
perhaps, for me to go against it. Got your pistol
with you, Nan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way you take care of yourself, is
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to be ashamed of yourself not to
be. And you don&#8217;t even know whom you&#8217;ll
meet before you can lock the front door again.
You promised me never to go out without it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
Promise me that once more, will you?&#8221; She did
as he asked her. &#8220;Now, give me your hand,
please,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;Take hold of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The butt of my revolver. Don&#8217;t be afraid.&#8221;
She heard the slight click of the hammer with a
thrill of strange apprehension. &#8220;What are you
doing?&#8221; she demanded hurriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your finger on the trigger&ndash;&ndash;so. It is
cocked. Now pull.&#8221;</p>
<p>She caught her breath. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was holding the gun in his two hands, his
fingers overlapping hers, the muzzle at the breast
of his jacket. &#8220;Pull,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;that&#8217;s all
you have to do; I&#8217;m steadying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She snatched back her hand. &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;For me to kill you?
Shame!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too excited&ndash;&ndash;all I asked you was to
take the trouble to crook your finger&ndash;&ndash;and I&#8217;ll
never speak to you again&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ll have your wish
forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shame?&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;I mean what I
say. If you meant what you said, why don&#8217;t
you put it out of my power ever to speak to you?
Do you want me to pull the trigger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you once I&#8217;m not an assassin&ndash;&ndash;how dare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
you ask me to do such a thing?&#8221; she cried furiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call your uncle,&#8221; he suggested coolly. &#8220;You
may hold this meantime so you&#8217;ll know he&#8217;s in
no danger. Take my gun and call your uncle&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shame on you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Call Gale&ndash;&ndash;call any man in the Gap&ndash;&ndash;they&#8217;ll
jump at the chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a cold-blooded, brutal wretch&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
sorry I ever helped you&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m sorry I ever let you
help me&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m sorry I ever saw you!&#8221;</p>
<p>She sprang away before he could interpose a
word. He stood stunned by the suddenness of
her outburst, trying to listen and to breathe at
the same time. He heard the front door close,
and stood waiting. But no further sound from
the house greeted his ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I thought,&#8221; he muttered to himself,
&#8220;that might calm her down a little. I&#8217;m certainly
in wrong, now.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>HER BAD PENNY</h3>
</div>
<p>Nan reached her room in a fever of excitement,
angry at de Spain, bitterly angry at
Gale, angry with the mountains, the world, and
resentfully fighting the pillow on which she cried
herself to sleep.</p>
<p>In the morning every nerve was on edge. When
her Uncle Duke, with his chopping utterance, said
something short to her at their very early breakfast
he was surprised by an answer equally short.
Her uncle retorted sharply. A second curt answer
greeted his rebuff, and while he stared at
her, Nan left the table and the room.</p>
<p>Duke, taking two of the men, started that
morning for Sleepy Cat with a bunch of cattle.
He rode a fractious horse, as he always did, and
this time the horse, infuriated as his horses frequently
were by his brutal treatment, bolted in a
moment unguarded by his master, and flung Duke
on his back in a strip of lava rocks.</p>
<p>The old man&ndash;&ndash;in the mountains a man is called
old after he passes forty&ndash;&ndash;was heavy, and the fall
a serious one. He picked himself up while the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
men were recovering his horse, knocked the horse
over with a piece of jagged rock when the frightened
beast was brought back, climbed into the
saddle again, and rode all the way into town.</p>
<p>But when his business was done, Duke, too,
was done. He could neither sit a horse, nor sit
in a wagon. Doctor Torpy, after an examination,
told him he was booked for the hospital. A
stream of profane protest made no difference with
his adviser, and, after many threats and hard
words, to the hospital the hard-shelled mountaineer
was taken. Sleepy Cat was stirred at the
news, and that the man who had defied everybody
in the mountains for twenty years should have
been laid low and sent to the hospital by a mere
bronco was the topic of many comments.</p>
<p>The men that had driven the cattle with Duke,
having been paid off, were now past getting home,
and there were no telephones in the Gap. De
Spain, who was at Calabasas, knew Nan would
not be alarmed should her uncle not return that
night. But early in the morning a messenger
from McAlpin rode to her with a note, telling her
of the accident.</p>
<p>Whatever his vices, Duke had been a good protector
to his dead brother&#8217;s child. He had sent
her to good schools and tried to revive in her, despite
her untoward surroundings, the better traditions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
of the family as it had once flourished in
Kentucky. Nan took the saddle for Sleepy Cat
in haste and alarm. When she reached her
uncle&#8217;s bedside she understood how seriously he
had been hurt, and the doctor&#8217;s warnings were
not needed to convince her he must have care.</p>
<p>Duke refused to let her leave him, in any case,
and Nan relieved the nurse, and what was of
equal moment, made herself custodian of the cash
in hand before Duke&#8217;s town companions could
get hold of it. Occasional trips to the Gap were
necessary as the weeks passed and her uncle
could not be moved. These Nan had feared as
threatening an encounter either by accident, or
on his part designed, with de Spain. But the
impending encounter never took place. De Spain,
attending closely to his own business, managed
to keep accurate track of her whereabouts without
getting in her way. She had come to Sleepy
Cat dreading to meet him and fearing his influence
over her, but this apprehension, with the
passing of a curiously brief period, dissolved into
a confidence in her ability to withstand further
interference, on any one&#8217;s part, with her feelings.</p>
<p>Gale Morgan rode into town frequently, and
Nan at first painfully apprehended hearing some
time of a deadly duel between her truculent Gap
admirer and her persistent town courtier&ndash;&ndash;who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
was more considerate and better-mannered, but
no less dogged and, in fact, a good deal more difficult
to handle.</p>
<p>As to the boisterous mountain-man, his resolute
little cousin made no secret of her detestation of
him. She denied and defied him as openly as a
girl could and heard his threats with continued
indifference. She was quite alone, too, in her
fear of any fatal meeting between the two men
who seemed determined to pursue her.</p>
<p>The truth was that after Calabasas, de Spain,
from Thief River to Sleepy Cat, was a marked
man. None sought to cross his path or his purposes.
Every one agreed he would yet be killed,
but not the hardiest of the men left to attack him
cared to undertake the job themselves. The
streets of the towns and the trails of the mountains
were free as the wind to de Spain. And
neither the town haunts of Calabasas men nor
those of their Morgan Gap sympathizers had any
champion disposed to follow too closely the alert
Medicine Bend railroader.</p>
<p>In and about the hospital, and in the town
itself, Nan found the chief obstacle to her peace
of mind in the talk she could not always avoid
hearing about de Spain. Convalescents in the corridors,
practically all of them men, never gathered
in sunny corners or at the tables in the dining-room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
without de Spain&#8217;s name coming in some
way into the talk, to be followed with varying
circumstantial accounts of what really had happened
that day at Calabasas.</p>
<p>And with all the known escapades in which he
had figured, exhausted as topics, by long-winded
commentators, more or less hazy stories of his
earlier experiences at Medicine Bend in the company
of Whispering Smith were dragged into the
talk. One convalescent stage-guard at the hospital
told a story one night at supper about him that
chilled Nan again with strange fears, for she knew
it to be true. He had had it from McAlpin himself,
so the guard said, that de Spain&#8217;s father had
long ago been shot down from ambush by a cattleman
and that Henry de Spain had sworn to
find that man and kill him. And it was hinted
pretty strongly that de Spain had information
when he consented to come to Sleepy Cat that
the assassin still lived, and lived somewhere
around the head of the Sinks.</p>
<p>That night, Nan dreamed. She dreamed of a
sinister mark on a face that she had never before
seen&ndash;&ndash;a face going into bronzed young manhood
with quick brown eyes looking eagerly at her.
And before her wondering look it faded, dreamlike,
into a soft mist, and where it had been, a man
lay, lifting himself on one arm from the ground&ndash;&ndash;his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
sleeve tattered, his collar torn, his eyes half-living,
half-dead, his hair clotted, his lips stiffened
and distended, his face drawn. And all of this
dissolved into an image of de Spain on horseback,
sudden, alert, threatening, looking through the
mist at an enemy. Then Nan heard the sharp report
of a rifle and saw him whirl half around&ndash;&ndash;struck&ndash;&ndash;in
his saddle, and fall. But he fell into
her arms, and she woke sobbing violently.</p>
<p>She was upset for the whole day, moody and
apprehensive, with a premonition that she should
soon see de Spain&ndash;&ndash;and, perhaps, hurt again.
The dream unnerved her every time she thought
of him. That evening the doctor came late.
When he walked in he asked her if she knew it
was Frontier Day, and reminded her that just a
year ago she had shot against Henry de Spain and
beaten the most dangerous man and the deadliest
shot on the mountain divide in her rifle match.
How he had grown in the imagination of Sleepy
Cat and Music Mountain, she said to herself&ndash;&ndash;while
the doctor talked to her uncle&ndash;&ndash;since that
day a year ago! Then he was no more than an
unknown and discomfited marksman from Medicine
Bend, beaten by a mountain girl: now the
most talked-of man in the high country. And the
suspicion would sometimes obtrude itself with
pride into her mind, that she who never mentioned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
his name when it was discussed before
her, really knew and understood him better than
any of those that talked so much&ndash;&ndash;that she had
at least one great secret with him alone.</p>
<p>When leaving, the doctor wished to send over
from his office medicine for her uncle. Nan offered
to go with him, but the doctor said it was
pretty late and Main Street pretty noisy: he preferred
to find a messenger.</p>
<p>Nan was sitting in the sick-room a little later&ndash;&ndash;B-19
in the old wing of the hospital, facing the
mountains&ndash;&ndash;when there came a rap on the half-open
door. She went forward to take the medicine
from the messenger and saw, standing before
her in the hall, de Spain.</p>
<p>She shrank back as if struck. She tried to
speak. Her tongue refused its office. De Spain
held a package out in his hand. &#8220;Doctor Torpy
asked me to give you this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Torpy? What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know&ndash;&ndash;I suppose it is medicine.&#8221;
She heard her uncle turn in his bed at the sound
of voices. Thinking only that he must not at
any cost see de Spain, Nan stepped quickly into
the hall and faced the messenger. &#8220;I was over
at the doctor&#8217;s office just now,&#8221; continued her
visitor evenly, &#8220;he asked me to bring this down
for your uncle.&#8221; She took the package with an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
incoherent acknowledgment. Without letting her
eyes meet his, she was conscious of how fresh and
clean and strong he looked, dressed in a livelier
manner than usual&ndash;&ndash;a partly cowboy effect, with
a broader Stetson and a gayer tie than he ordinarily
affected. De Spain kept on speaking:
&#8220;The telephone girl in the office down-stairs told
me to come right up. How is your uncle?&#8221;</p>
<p>She regarded him wonderingly: &#8220;He has a
good deal of pain,&#8221; she answered quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too bad he should have been hurt in such a
way. Are you pretty well, Nan?&#8221; She thanked
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got over being mad at me?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she averred resolutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re not,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;I&#8217;m not
over being mad at myself. Haven&#8217;t seen you
for a long time. Stay here a good deal, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you don&#8217;t know what day this is?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan looked up the corridor, but she answered
to the point: &#8220;You&#8217;d lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our anniversary.&#8221; She darted a look of
indignant disclaimer at him. But in doing so
she met his eyes. &#8220;Have you seen the decorations
in Main Street?&#8221; he asked indifferently.
&#8220;Come out for a minute and look at them.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>She shook her head: &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to,&#8221; she
answered, looking restlessly, this time, down the
corridor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to the door just a minute and see the
way they&#8217;ve lighted the arches.&#8221; She knew just
the expression of his eyes that went with that
tone. She looked vexedly at him to confirm her
suspicion. Sure enough there in the brown part
and in the lids, it was, the most troublesome possible
kind of an expression&ndash;&ndash;hard to be resolute
against. Her eyes fell away, but some damage
had been done. He did not say another word.
None seemed necessary. He just kept still and
something&ndash;&ndash;no one could have said just what&ndash;&ndash;seemed
to talk for him to poor defenseless Nan.
She hesitated helplessly: &#8220;I can&#8217;t leave uncle,&#8221;
she objected at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask him to come along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes fluttered about the dimly lighted
hall: de Spain gazed on her as steadily as a
charmer. &#8220;I ought not to leave even for a minute,&#8221;
she protested weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay here at the door while you go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Irresolute, she let her eyes rest again for a
fraction of a second on his eyes; when she drew
a breath after that pause everything was over.
&#8220;I&#8217;d better give him his medicine first,&#8221; she said,
looking toward the sick-room door.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>His monosyllabic answer was calm: &#8220;Do.&#8221;
Then as she laid her hand on the knob of the
door to enter the room: &#8220;Can I help any?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; she cried indignantly.</p>
<p>He laughed silently: &#8220;I&#8217;ll stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan disappeared. Lounging against the window-sill
opposite the door, he waited. After a
long time the door was stealthily reopened. Nan
tiptoed out. She closed it softly behind her: &#8220;I
waited for him to go to sleep,&#8221; she explained as she
started down the corridor with de Spain. &#8220;He&#8217;s
had so much pain to-day: I hope he will sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, too,&#8221; exclaimed de Spain fervently.</p>
<p>Nan ignored the implication. She looked
straight ahead. She had nothing to say. De
Spain, walking beside her, devoured her with his
eyes; listened to her footfalls; tried to make
talk; but Nan was silent.</p>
<p>Standing on the wide veranda outside the
front door, she assented to the beauty of the distant
illumination but not enthusiastically. De
Spain declared it could be seen very much better
from the street below. Nan thought she could
see very well where they stood. But by this
time she was answering questions&ndash;&ndash;dryly, it is
true and in monosyllables, but answering. De
Spain leading the way a step or two forward at a
time, coaxed her down the driveway.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>She stood again irresolute, he drinking in the
fragrance of her presence after the long separation
and playing her reluctance guardedly. &#8220;Do
you know,&#8221; she exclaimed with sudden resentment,
&#8220;you make it awfully hard to be mean to
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a laugh he caught her hand and made her
walk down the hospital steps. &#8220;You may be as
mean as you like,&#8221; he answered indifferently.
&#8220;Only, never ask me to be mean to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish to heaven you would be,&#8221; she retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;what we were
doing a year ago to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; Before he could speak again she changed
her answer: &#8220;Yes, I do remember. If I said &#8216;no&#8217;
you&#8217;d be sure to remind me of what we were doing.
We can&#8217;t see as well here as we could from
the steps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But from here, you have the best view in
Sleepy Cat of Music Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t come out here to see Music Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I come here often to look at it. You won&#8217;t
let me see you&ndash;&ndash;what can I do but look at where
you live? How long are you going to keep me
away from you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan did not answer. He urged her to speak.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
&#8220;You know very well it is my people that will
never be friendly with you,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;How
can I be?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were passing a lawn settee. He sat down.
She would not follow. She stood in a sort of protest
at his side, but he did not release her hand.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you how you can be,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;Make me one of your people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That never can be,&#8221; she declared stubbornly.
&#8220;You know it as well as I do. Why do you say
such things?&#8221; she demanded, drawing away her
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She strove to command herself: &#8220;Whether
you do or not can&#8217;t make any difference,&#8221; she
returned steadily. &#8220;We are separated by everything.
There&#8217;s a gulf between us. It never can
be crossed. We should both of us be wretched if
it ever were crossed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had risen from the bench and caught her
hand: &#8220;It&#8217;s because we haven&#8217;t crossed it we&#8217;re
wretched,&#8221; he said determinedly. &#8220;Cross it with
me now!&#8221; He caught her in his arms. She
struggled to escape. She knew what was coming
and fought to keep her face from him. With resistless
strength and yet carefully as a mother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
with an obstinate child, he held her slight body
against his breast, relentlessly drawing her head
closer. &#8220;Let me go!&#8221; she panted, twisting her
averted head from the hollow of his arm. Drinking
in the wine of her frightened breath, he bent
over her in the darkness until his pulsing eagerness
linked her warm lips to his own. She had
surrendered to his first kiss.</p>
<p>He spoke. &#8220;The gulf&#8217;s crossed. Are you so
awfully wretched?&#8221;</p>
<p>They sank together down on the bench.
&#8220;What,&#8221; she faltered, &#8220;will become of me now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are better off now than you ever were,
Nan. You&#8217;ve gained this moment a big brother,
a lover you can drag around the world after you
with a piece of thread.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You act as if I could!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean it: it&#8217;s true. I&#8217;m pledged to you forever&ndash;&ndash;you,
to me, forever. We&#8217;ll keep our secret
till we can manage things; and we <i>will</i> manage
them. Everything will come right, Nan, because
everything must come right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only hope you are not wrong,&#8221; she murmured,
her eyes turned toward the sombre mountains.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>DANGER</h3>
</div>
<p>With never such apprehension, never such
stealth, never so heavy a secret, so sensible
a burning in cheek and eye, as when she tiptoed
into her uncle&#8217;s room at midnight, Nan&#8217;s
heart beat as the wings of a bird beat from the
broken door of a cage into a forbidden sky of happiness.
She had left the room a girl; she came
back to it a woman.</p>
<p>Sleep she did not expect or even ask for; the
night was all too short to think of those tense,
fearful moments that had pledged her to her
lover. When the anxieties of her situation overwhelmed
her, as they would again and again, she
felt herself in the arms of this strange, resolute
man whom all her own hated and whom she
knew she already loved beyond all power to put
away. In her heart, she had tried this more than
once: she knew she could not, would not ever do
it, or even try to do it, again.</p>
<p>She rejoiced in his love. She trusted. When
he spoke she believed this man whom no one
around her would believe; and she, who never had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
believed what other men avowed, and who detested
their avowals, believed de Spain, and secretly,
guiltily, glowed in every word of his devotion
and breathed faint in its every caress.</p>
<p>Night could hardly come fast enough, after
the next long day. A hundred times during that
day she reminded herself, while the slow, majestic
sun shone simmering on the hot desert, that
she had promised to steal out into the grounds the
minute darkness fell&ndash;&ndash;he would be waiting. A
hundred times in the long afternoon, Nan looked
into the cloudless western sky and with puny
eager hands would have pushed the lagging orb
on its course that she might sooner give herself
into the arms where she felt her place so sure, her
honor so safe, her helplessness so protected, herself
so loved.</p>
<p>How her cheeks burned after supper when she
asked her uncle for leave to post a letter down-town!
How breathless with apprehension she
halted as de Spain stepped from the shadow of
the trees and drew her importunately beneath
them for the kiss that had burned on her troubled
lips all day! How, girl-like, knowing his caresses
were all her own&ndash;&ndash;knowing she could at an instant
call forth enough to smother her&ndash;&ndash;she
tyrannized his importuning and, like a lovely
miser, hoarded her responsiveness under calm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
eyes and laconic whispers until, when she did give
back his eagerness, she made his senses reel.</p>
<p>How dreamily she listened to every word he let
fall in his outpouring of devotion; how gravely
she put up her hand to restrain his busy intrusion,
and asked if he knew that no man in the
world, least of all her fierce and burly cousin, had
ever touched her lips until he himself forced a
kiss on them the night before: &#8220;And now!&#8221; She
hid her face against his shoulder. &#8220;Oh, Henry,
how I love you! I&#8217;m so ashamed, I couldn&#8217;t tell
you if it weren&#8217;t night: I&#8217;ll never look you in the
face again in the daytime.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when he told her how little he himself had
had to do with, and how little he knew about
girls, even from boyhood, how she feigned not to
believe, and believed him still! They were two
children raised in the magic of an hour to the
supreme height of life and dizzy together on its
summit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you can care for <i>me</i>, Henry.
Oh, I mean it,&#8221; she protested, holding her head
resolutely up. &#8220;You know who we are, away off
there in the mountains. Every one hates us; I
suppose they&#8217;ve plenty of reason to: we hate
everybody else. And why shouldn&#8217;t we? We&#8217;re
at war with every one. You know, better than I
do, what goes on in the Gap. I don&#8217;t want to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
know; I try not to know; Uncle Duke tries to
keep things from me. When you began to act&ndash;&ndash;as
if you cared for me&ndash;&ndash;that day on Music&ndash;&ndash;I
couldn&#8217;t believe you meant it at all. And yet&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m
afraid I liked to try to think you did. When
you looked at me I felt as if you could see right
through me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Confidences never came to an end.</p>
<p>And diplomacy came into its own almost at
once in de Spain&#8217;s efforts to improve his relations
with the implacable Duke. The day came when
Nan&#8217;s uncle could be taken home. De Spain sent
to him a soft-spoken emissary, Bob Scott, offering
to provide a light stage, with his compliments,
for the trip. The intractable mountaineer,
with his refusal to accept the olive-branch,
blew Bob out of the room. Nan was crushed by
the result, but de Spain was not to be dismayed.</p>
<p>Lefever came to him the day after Nan had
got her uncle home. &#8220;Henry,&#8221; he began without
any preliminaries, &#8220;there is one thing about
your precipitate ride up Music Mountain that I
never got clear in my mind. After the fight, your
cartridge-belt was hanging up in the barn at
Calabasas for two weeks. You walked in to us
that morning with your belt buckled on. You
told us you put it on before you came up-stairs.
What? Oh, yes, I know, Henry. But that belt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
wasn&#8217;t hanging down-stairs with your coat earlier
in the evening. No, Henry: it wasn&#8217;t, not
when I looked. Don&#8217;t tell me such things, because&ndash;&ndash;I
don&#8217;t know. Where was the belt when
you found it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some distance from the coat, John. I admit
that. I&#8217;ll tell you: some one had moved the belt.
It was not where I left it. I was hurried the
morning I rode in and I can&#8217;t tell you just where
I found it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever never batted an eyelash. &#8220;I know you
can&#8217;t, Henry. Because you won&#8217;t. That Scotch
hybrid McAlpin knows a few things, too, that
he won&#8217;t tell. All I want to say is, you can trust
that man too far. He&#8217;s got all my recent salary.
Every time Jeffries raises my pay that hairy-pawed
horse-doctor reduces it just so much a
month. And he does it with one pack of fifty-two
small cards that you could stick into your
vest pocket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McAlpin has a wife and children to support,&#8221;
suggested de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think for a moment he does it,&#8221; returned
Lefever vehemently. &#8220;I support his wife
and children, myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t play cards, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was by playing cards that I located Sassoon,
just the same. A little game with your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
friend Bull Page, by the way. And say, that man
blew into Calabasas one day here lately with a
twenty-dollar bill; it&#8217;s a fact. Now, where do
you suppose he got twenty dollars in one bill?
I know <i>I</i> had it two hours after he got there and
then in fifteen minutes that blamed bull-whacker
you pay thirty-two a week to took it away from
me. But I got Sassoon spotted. And where do
you suppose Split-lips is this minute?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morgan&#8217;s Gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so&ndash;&ndash;and been there all the time. Now,
Bob has the old warrant for him: the question
is, how to get him out.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain reflected a moment before replying:
&#8220;John, I&#8217;d let him alone just for the present,&#8221;
he said at length.</p>
<p>Lefever&#8217;s eyes bulged: &#8220;Let Sassoon alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will keep&ndash;&ndash;for a while, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to stir things up too strong over
that way just at the minute, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain shuffled a little: &#8220;Well, Jeffries
thinks we might let things rest till Duke Morgan
and the others get over some of their soreness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever, astonished at the indifference of de
Spain to the opportunity of nabbing Sassoon,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
while he could be found, expostulated strongly.
When de Spain persisted, Lefever, huffed, confided
to Bob Scott that when the general manager
got ready he could catch Sassoon himself.</p>
<p>De Spain wanted for Nan&#8217;s sake, as well as his
own, to see what could be done to pacify her
uncle and his relatives so that a wedge might be
driven in between them and their notorious
henchman, and Sassoon brought to book with
their consent; on this point, however, he was
not quite bold-faced enough to take his friends
into his confidence.</p>
<p>De Spain, as fiery a lover as he was a fighter,
stayed none of his courting because circumstances
put Music Mountain between him and his mistress.
And Nan, after she had once surrendered,
was nothing behind in the chances she unhesitatingly
took to arrange her meetings with de
Spain. He found in her, once her girlish timidity
was overcome and a woman&#8217;s confidence had replaced
it, a disregard of consequences, so far as
their own plans were concerned, that sometimes
took away his breath.</p>
<p>The very day after she had got her uncle home,
with the aid of Satterlee Morgan and an antiquated
spring wagon, Nan rode, later in the
afternoon, over to Calabasas. The two that
would not be restrained had made their appointment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
at the lower lava beds half-way between the
Gap and Calabasas. The sun was sinking behind
the mountain when de Spain galloped out
of the rocks as Nan turned from the trail and
rode toward the black and weather-beaten meeting-place.</p>
<p>They could hardly slip from their saddles fast
enough to reach each other&#8217;s arms&ndash;&ndash;Nan, trim
as a model in fresh khaki, trying with a handkerchief
hardly larger than a postage-stamp to wipe
the flecks of dust from her pink cheeks, while
de Spain, between dabs, covered them with importunate
greetings. Looking engrossed into
each other&#8217;s eyes, and both, in their eagerness,
talking at once, they led their horses into hiding
and sat down to try to tell all that had happened
since their parting. Wars and rumors of wars,
feuds and raidings, fights and pursuits were no
more to them than to babes in the woods. All
that mattered to them&ndash;&ndash;sitting or pacing together
and absorbed, in the path of the long-cold
volcanic stream buried in the shifting sands of
the desert&ndash;&ndash;was that they should clasp each
other&#8217;s clinging hands, listen each to the other&#8217;s
answering voice, look unrestrained into each
other&#8217;s questioning eyes.</p>
<p>They met in both the lava beds&ndash;&ndash;the upper lay
between the Gap and town&ndash;&ndash;more than once.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
And one day came a scare. They were sitting
on a little ledge well up in the rocks where de
Spain could overlook the trail east and west, and
were talking about a bungalow some day to be in
Sleepy Cat, when they saw men riding from the
west toward Calabasas. There were three in the
party, one lagging well behind. The two men
leading, Nan and de Spain made out to be Gale
Morgan and Page. They saw the man coming
on behind stop his horse and lean forward, his
head bent over the trail. He was examining the
sand and halted quite a minute to study something.
Both knew what he was studying&ndash;&ndash;the
hoof-prints of Nan&#8217;s pony heading toward the
lava. Nan shrank back and with de Spain moved
a little to where they could watch the intruder
without being seen. Nan whispered first: &#8220;It&#8217;s
Sassoon.&#8221; De Spain nodded. &#8220;What shall we
do?&#8221; breathed Nan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing yet,&#8221; returned her lover, watching
the horseman, whose eyes were still fixed on the
pony&#8217;s trail, but who was now less than a half
mile away and riding straight toward them.</p>
<p>De Spain, his eyes on the danger and his hand
laid behind Nan&#8217;s waist, led the way guardedly
down to where their horses stood. Nan, needing
no instructions for the emergency, took the lines
of the horses, and de Spain, standing beside his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
own horse, reached his right hand over in front
of the pommel and, regarding Sassoon all the
while, drew his rifle slowly from its scabbard.
The blood fled Nan&#8217;s cheeks. She said nothing.
Without looking at her, de Spain drew her own
rifle from her horse&#8217;s side, passed it into her hand
and, moving over in front of the horses, laid his
left hand reassuringly on her waist again. At
that moment, little knowing what eyes were on
him in the black fragments ahead, Sassoon looked
up. Then he rode more slowly forward. The color
returned to Nan&#8217;s cheeks: &#8220;Do you want me to
use this?&#8221; she murmured, indicating the rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not. But if the others turn back,
I may need it. Stay right here with the horses.
He will lose the trail in a minute now. When
he reaches the rock I&#8217;ll go down and keep him
from getting off his horse&ndash;&ndash;he won&#8217;t fight from
the saddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>But with an instinct better than knowledge,
Sassoon, like a wolf scenting danger, stopped
again. He scanned the broken and forbidding
hump in front, now less than a quarter of a mile
from him, questioningly. His eyes seemed to
rove inquisitively over the lava pile as if asking
why a Morgan Gap pony had visited it. In another
moment he wheeled his horse and spurred
rapidly after his companions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>The two drew a deep breath. De Spain
laughed: &#8220;What we don&#8217;t know, never hurts
us.&#8221; He drew Nan to him. Holding the rifle
muzzle at arm&#8217;s length as the butt rested on the
ground, she looked up from the shoulder to which
she was drawn: &#8220;What should you have done
if he had come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Taken you to the Gap and then taken him
to Sleepy Cat, where he belongs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Henry, suppose&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There wouldn&#8217;t have been any &#8216;suppose.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose the others had come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With one rifle, here, a man could stand off a
regiment. Nan, do you know, you fit into my
arm as if you were made for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>His courage was contagious. When he had
tired her with fresh importunities he unpinned
her felt hat and held it out of reach while he kissed
and toyed with and disarranged her hair. In revenge,
she snatched from his pocket his little
black memorandum-book and some letters and
read, or pretended to read them, and seizing her
opportunity she broke from him and ran with the
utmost fleetness up into the rocks.</p>
<p>In two minutes they had forgotten the episode
almost as completely as if it never had been.
But when they left for home, they agreed they
would not meet there again. They knew that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
Sassoon, like a jackal, would surely come back,
and more than once, until he found out just
what that trail or any subsequent trail leading
into the beds meant. The lovers laughed the
jackal&#8217;s spying to scorn and rode away, bantering,
racing, and chasing each other in the saddle,
as solely concerned in their happiness as if there
were nothing else of moment in the whole wide
world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>FACING THE MUSIC</h3>
</div>
<p>They had not underestimated the danger
from Sassoon&#8217;s suspicious malevolence. He
returned next morning to read what further he
could among the rocks. It was little, but it
spelled a meeting of two people&ndash;&ndash;Nan and another&ndash;&ndash;and
he was stimulated to keep his eyes
and ears open for further discoveries. Moreover,
continuing ease in seeing each other, undetected
by hostile eyes, gradually rendered the lovers less
cautious in their arrangements. The one thing
that possessed their energies was to be together.</p>
<p>De Spain, naturally reckless, had won in Nan
a girl hardly more concerned. Self-reliant, both
of them, and instinctively vigilant, they spent so
much time together that Scott and Lefever, who,
before a fortnight had passed after Duke&#8217;s return
home, surmised that de Spain must be carrying
on some sort of a clandestine affair hinting toward
the Gap, only questioned how long it would be
before something happened, and only hoped it
would not be, in their own word, unpleasant. It
was not theirs in any case to admonish de
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
Spain, nor to dog the movements of so capable
a friend even when his safety was concerned, so
long as he preferred to keep his own counsel&ndash;&ndash;there
are limits within which no man welcomes
uninvited assistance. And de Spain, in his long
and frequent rides, his protracted absences, indifference
to the details of business and careless
humor, had evidently passed within these limits.</p>
<p>What was stage traffic to him compared to the
sunshine on Nan&#8217;s hair; what attraction had
schedules to offer against a moment of her eyes;
what pleasing connection could there be between
bad-order wheels and her low laugh?</p>
<p>The two felt they must meet to discuss their
constant perplexities and the problems of their difficult
situation; but when they reached their
trysting-places, there was more of gayety than
gravity, more of nonchalance than concern, more
of looking into each other&#8217;s hearts than looking
into the troublesome future. And there was
hardly an inviting spot within miles of Music
Mountain that one or the other of the two had
not waited near.</p>
<p>There were, of course, disappointments, but
there were only a few failures in their arrangements.
The difficulties of these fell chiefly on
Nan. How she overcame them was a source of
surprise to de Spain, who marvelled at her innocent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
resource in escaping the demands at home
and making her way, despite an array of obstacles,
to his distant impatience.</p>
<p>Midway between Music Mountain and Sleepy
Cat a low-lying wall of lava rock, in part sand-covered
and in part exposed, parallels and sometimes
crosses the principal trail. This undulating
ridge was a favorite with de Spain and Nan, because
they could ride in and out of hiding-places
without more than just leaving the trail itself.
To the west of this ridge, and commanding it,
rose rather more than a mile away the cone called
Black Cap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said Nan one afternoon, looking
from de Spain&#8217;s side toward the mountains,
&#8220;some one should be spying on us from Black
Cap?&#8221; She pointed to the solitary rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any one has been, Nan, with a good glass
he must have seen exchanges of confidence over
here that would make him gnash his teeth. I
know if I ever saw anything like it I&#8217;d go hang.
But the country around there is too rough for a
horse. Nobody even hides around Black Cap,
except some tramp hold-up man that&#8217;s crowded
in his get-away. Bob Scott says there are dozens
of mountain-lions over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sassoon had the unpleasant patience of a
mountain-lion and its dogged persistence, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
hiding himself on Black Cap, he made certain one
day of what he had long been convinced&ndash;&ndash;that
Nan was meeting de Spain.</p>
<p>The day after she had mentioned Black Cap
to her lover, Nan rode over to Calabasas to get a
bridle mended. Galloping back, she encountered
Sassoon just inside the Gap. Nan so detested
him that she never spoke when she could avoid it.
On his part he pretended not to see her as she
passed. When she reached home she found her
Uncle Duke and Gale standing in front of the fireplace
in the living-room. The two appeared from
their manner to have been in a heated discussion,
one that had stopped suddenly on her appearance.
Both looked at Nan. The expression on their
faces forewarned her. She threw her quirt on
the table, drew off her riding-gloves, and began
to unpin her hat; but she knew a storm was impending.</p>
<p>Gale had been made for a long time to know
that he was an unwelcome visitor, and Nan&#8217;s
greeting of him was the merest contemptuous
nod. &#8220;Well, uncle,&#8221; she said, glancing at Duke,
&#8220;I&#8217;m late again. Have you had supper?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duke always spoke curtly; to-night his heavy
voice was as sharp as an axe. &#8220;Been late a good
deal lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan laid her hat on the table and, glancing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
composedly from one suspicious face to the other,
put her hands up to rearrange her hair. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to try to do better. I&#8217;ll go out and get my
supper if you&#8217;ve had yours.&#8221; She started toward
the dining-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; Nan paused at her uncle&#8217;s ferocious
command. She looked at him either really
or feignedly surprised, her expression changing to
one of indignation, and waited for him to speak.
Since he did no more than glare angrily at her,
Nan lifted her brows a little. &#8220;What do you
want, uncle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you go this afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over to Calabasas,&#8221; she answered innocently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;d you meet there?&#8221; Duke&#8217;s tone
snapped with anger. He was working himself
into a fury, but Nan saw it must be faced. &#8220;The
same people I usually meet&ndash;&ndash;why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you meet Henry de Spain there this
afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan looked squarely at her cousin and returned
his triumphant expression defiantly before she
turned her eyes on her uncle. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said
collectedly. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you deny it?&#8221; he thundered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I deny it. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see de Spain at Calabasas this afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See him anywhere else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I did not. What do you mean? What,&#8221;
demanded his niece with spirit, &#8220;do you want to
know? What are you trying to find out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duke turned in his rage on Gale. &#8220;There!
You hear that&ndash;&ndash;what have you got to say now?&#8221;
he demanded with an abusive oath.</p>
<p>Gale, who had been hardly able to refrain from
breaking in, answered fast. &#8220;What have I got
to say?&#8221; he roared. &#8220;I say I know what I&#8217;m
talking about. I say she&#8217;s lying, Duke.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan&#8217;s face turned white with anger. Before
she could speak her uncle took up the words.
&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me she lies.&#8221;
He launched another hot expletive. &#8220;I know she
doesn&#8217;t lie!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gale jumped forward, his finger pointed at
Nan. &#8220;Look here, do you deny you are meeting
Henry de Spain all over the desert?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan&#8217;s anger supported her without a tremor.
&#8220;Who are you to ask me whom I meet or don&#8217;t
meet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been meeting de Spain right along,
haven&#8217;t you? You met him down the Sleepy
Cat trail near Black Cap, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan stood with her back against the end of the
table where her uncle&#8217;s first words had stopped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
her, and she looked sidewise toward her cousin.
In her answer he heard as much contempt as a
girl&#8217;s voice could carry to a rejected lover. &#8220;So
you&#8217;ve turned sneak!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gale roared a string of bad words.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hire that coyote, Sassoon, to spy for you,
do you?&#8221; demanded Nan coolly. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
proud of your manly relation, uncle?&#8221; Duke
was choking with rage. He tried to speak to her,
but he could not form his words. &#8220;What is it
you want to know, uncle? Whether it is true that
I meet Henry de Spain? It is. I do meet him,
and we&#8217;re engaged to be married when you give
us permission, Uncle Duke&ndash;&ndash;and not till then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you have it,&#8221; cried Gale. &#8220;There&#8217;s the
story. I told you so. I&#8217;ve known it for a week,
I tell you.&#8221; Nan&#8217;s face set. &#8220;Not only,&#8221; continued
her cousin jeeringly, &#8220;meeting that&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost before the vile epithet that followed had
reached her ears, Nan caught up the whip. Before
he could escape she cut Gale sharply across
the face. &#8220;You coward,&#8221; she cried, trembling so
she could not control her voice. &#8220;If you ever
dare use that word before me again, I&#8217;ll horsewhip
you. Go to Henry de Spain&#8217;s face, you
skulker, and say that if you dare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put down that quirt, Nan,&#8221; yelled her uncle.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t put it down,&#8221; she exclaimed defiantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
&#8220;And he will get a good lashing with it if he says
one more word about Henry de Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put down that quirt, I tell you,&#8221; thundered
her uncle.</p>
<p>She whirled. &#8220;I won&#8217;t put it down. This
hulking bully! I know him better than you do.&#8221;
She pointed a quivering finger at her cousin. &#8220;He
insulted me as vilely as he could only a few months
ago on Music Mountain. And if this very same
Henry de Spain hadn&#8217;t happened to be there to
protect me, you would have found me dead next
morning by my own hand. Do you understand?&#8221;
she cried, panting and furious. &#8220;That&#8217;s what he
is!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her uncle tried to break in. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; she exclaimed,
pointing at Gale. &#8220;<i>He</i> never told you
that, did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; nor you neither,&#8221; snapped Duke hoarsely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; retorted Nan, &#8220;because
I&#8217;ve been trying to live with you here in peace
among these thieves and cutthroats, and not
keep you stirred up all the time. And Henry de
Spain faced this big coward and protected me
from him with an empty revolver! What business
of yours is it whom I meet, or where I go?&#8221;
she demanded, raining her words with flaming
eyes on her belligerent cousin. &#8220;I will never
marry you to save you from the hangman. Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
leave this house.&#8221; She stamped her foot. &#8220;Leave
this house, and never come into it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Gale, beside himself with rage, stood his ground.
He poured all that he safely could of abuse on
Nan&#8217;s own head. She had appeased her wrath
and made no attempt to retort, only looking at
him with white face and burning eyes as she
breathed defiance. Duke interfered. &#8220;Get out!&#8221;
he said to Gale harshly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll talk to her. Go
home!&#8221;</p>
<p>Not ceasing to mutter threats, Gale picked up
his hat and stamped out of the house, slamming
the doors. Duke, exhausted by the quarrel, sat
down, eying his niece. &#8220;Now what does this
mean?&#8221; he demanded hoarsely.</p>
<p>She tried to tell him honestly and frankly all
that her acquaintance with de Spain did mean&ndash;&ndash;dwelling
no more than was necessary on its beginning,
but concealing nothing of its development
and consequences, nothing of her love for
de Spain, nor of his for her. But no part of
what she could say on any point she urged softened
her uncle&#8217;s face. His square hard jaw from
beginning to end looked like stone.</p>
<p>&#8220;So he&#8217;s your lover?&#8221; he said harshly when
she had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to be your friend,&#8221; returned Nan,
determined not to give up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>Duke looked at her uncompromisingly: &#8220;That
man can&#8217;t ever be any friend of mine&ndash;&ndash;understand
that! He can&#8217;t ever marry you. If he ever
tries to, so help me God, I&#8217;ll kill him if I hang for
it. I know his game. I know what he wants.
He doesn&#8217;t care a pinch of snuff about you. He
thinks he can hit me a blow by getting you away
from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing could be further from the truth,&#8221;
exclaimed Nan hopelessly.</p>
<p>Duke struck the table a smashing blow with
his fist. &#8220;I&#8217;ll show Mr. de Spain and his friends
where they get off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Duke, if you won&#8217;t listen to reason, you
must listen to sense. Think of what a position
you put me in. I love you for all your care of
me. I love him for his affection for me and consideration
of me&ndash;&ndash;because he knows how to treat
a woman. I know he wouldn&#8217;t harm a hair on
your head, for my sake, yet you talk now of
bloodshed between you two. I know what your
words mean&ndash;&ndash;that one of you, or both of you are
to be killed for a senseless feud. He will not
stand up and let any man shoot him down without
resistance. If you lay your blood on his head,
you know it would put a stain between him and
me that never could be washed out as long as
we lived. If you kill him I could never stay here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
with you. His blood would cry out every day
and night against you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duke&#8217;s violent finger shot out at her. &#8220;And
you&#8217;re the gal I took from your mammy and
promised I&#8217;d bring up a decent woman. You&#8217;ve
got none o&#8217; her blood in you&ndash;&ndash;not a drop. You&#8217;re
the brat of that damned, mincing brother of mine,
that was always riding horseback and showing off
in town while I was weeding the tobacco-beds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan clasped her hands. &#8220;Don&#8217;t blame me
because I&#8217;m your brother&#8217;s child. Blame me because
I&#8217;m a woman, because I have a heart, because
I want to live and see you live, and to see
you live in peace instead of what we do live in&ndash;&ndash;suspicion,
distrust, feuds, alarms, and worse.
I&#8217;m not ungrateful, as you plainly say I am. I
want you to get out of what you are in here&ndash;&ndash;I
want to be out of it. I&#8217;d rather be dead now
than to live and die in it. And what is this anger
all for? Nothing. He offers you his friendship&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
She could speak no further. Her uncle with a
curse left her alone. When she arose in the early
morning he had already gone away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>A TRY OUT</h3>
</div>
<p>Sleepy Cat is not so large a place that one
would ordinarily have much trouble in finding
a man in it if one searched well. But Duke Morgan
drove into town next morning and had to
stay for three days waiting for a chance to meet
de Spain. Duke was not a man to talk much
when he had anything of moment to put through,
and he had left home determined, before he came
back, to finish for good with his enemy.</p>
<p>De Spain himself had been putting off for weeks
every business that would bear putting off, and
had been forced at length to run down to Medicine
Bend to buy horses. Nan, after her uncle left
home&ndash;&ndash;justly apprehensive of his intentions&ndash;&ndash;made
frantic efforts to get word to de Spain of
what was impending. She could not telegraph&ndash;&ndash;a
publicity that she dreaded would have followed
at once. De Spain had expected to be back in
two days. Such a letter as she could have sent
would not reach him at Medicine Bend.</p>
<p>As it was, a distressing amount of talk did
attend Duke&#8217;s efforts to get track of de Spain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
Sleepy Cat had but one interpretation for his inquiries&ndash;&ndash;and
a fight, if one occurred between these
men, it was conceded would be historic in the
annals of the town. Its anticipation was food for
all of the rumors of three days of suspense. For
the town they were three days of thrilling expectation;
for Nan, isolated, without a confidant, not
knowing what to do or which way to turn, they
were the three bitterest days of anxiety she had
ever known.</p>
<p>Desperate with suspense at the close of the
second day&ndash;&ndash;wild for a scrap of news, yet dreading
one&ndash;&ndash;she saddled her pony and rode alone into
Sleepy Cat after nightfall to meet the train on
which de Spain had told her he would return from
the east. She rode straight to the hospital, instead
of going to the livery-barn, and leaving her
horse, got supper and walked by way of unfrequented
streets down-town to the station to wait
for the train.</p>
<p>Never had she felt so miserable, so helpless, so
forsaken, so alone. With the thought of her nearest
relative, the man who had been a father to
her and provided a home for her as long as she
could remember, seeking to kill him whose devotion
had given her all the happiness she had ever
known, and whose safety meant her only pledge
of happiness for the future&ndash;&ndash;her heart sank.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>When the big train drew slowly, almost noiselessly,
in, Nan took her place where no incoming
passenger could escape her gaze and waited for
de Spain. Scanning eagerly the figures of the
men that walked up the long platform and approached
the station exit, the fear that she should
not see him battled with the hope that he would
still appear. But when all the arrivals had been
accounted for, he had not come.</p>
<p>She turned, heavy-hearted, to walk back uptown,
trying to think of whom she might seek
some information concerning de Spain&#8217;s whereabouts,
when her eye fell on a man standing not
ten feet away at the door of the baggage-room.
He was alone and seemed to be watching the
changing of the engines, but Nan thought she
knew him by sight. The rather long, straight,
black hair under the broad-brimmed Stetson hat
marked the man known and hated in the Gap as
&#8220;the Indian.&#8221; Here, she said to herself, was a
chance. De Spain, she recalled, spoke of no one
oftener than this man. He seemed wholly disengaged.</p>
<p>Repressing her nervous timidity, Nan walked
over to him. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you Mr. Scott?&#8221; she asked
abruptly.</p>
<p>Scott, turning to her, touched his hat as if
quite unaware until that moment of her existence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
&#8220;Did Mr. de Spain get off this train?&#8221; she asked,
as Scott acknowledged his identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see him. I guess he didn&#8217;t come to-night.&#8221;
Nan noticed the impassive manner of
his speaking and the low, even tones. &#8220;I was
kind of looking for him myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there another train to-night he could come
on?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he will be back now before to-morrow
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan, much disappointed, looked up the line
and down. &#8220;I rode in this afternoon from Music
Mountain especially to see him.&#8221; Scott, without
commenting, smiled with understanding and encouragement,
and Nan was so filled with anxiety
that she welcomed a chance to talk to somebody.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve often heard him speak of you,&#8221; she ventured,
searching the dark eyes, and watching
the open, kindly smile characteristic of the
man. Scott put his right hand out at his side.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve ridden with that boy since he was so
high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he thinks everything of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know me?&#8221; she said tentatively.</p>
<p>His answer concealed all that was necessary.
&#8220;Not to speak to, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Nan Morgan.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I know your name pretty well,&#8221; he explained;
nothing seemed to disturb his smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I came in&ndash;&ndash;because I was worried over
something and wanted to see Mr. de Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is buying horses north of Medicine Bend.
The rain-storm yesterday likely kept him back
some. I don&#8217;t think you need worry much over
anything though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean I am worrying about Mr. de
Spain at Medicine Bend,&#8221; disclaimed Nan with
a trace of embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you mean,&#8221; smiled Bob Scott.
She regarded him questioningly. He returned
her gaze reassuringly as if he was confident of his
ground. &#8220;Did your pony come along all right
after you left the foot-hills this afternoon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan opened her eyes. &#8220;How did you know I
came through the foot-hills?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was over that way to-day.&#8221; Something in
the continuous smile enlightened her more than
the word. &#8220;I noticed your pony went lame.
You stopped to look at his foot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were behind me,&#8221; exclaimed Nan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t see you,&#8221; he countered prudently.</p>
<p>She seemed to fathom something from the expression
of his face. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t have known
I was coming in,&#8221; she said quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; He paused. Her eyes seemed to invite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
a further confidence. &#8220;But after you started
it would be a pity if any harm came to you on
the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew Uncle Duke was in town?&#8221; Scott
nodded. &#8220;Do you know why I came?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made a guess at it. I don&#8217;t think you need
worry over anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Uncle Duke been talking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Uncle Duke doesn&#8217;t talk much, you
know. But he had to ask questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you follow me down from the hospital
to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was coming from my house after supper. I
only kept close enough to you to be handy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I understand. And you are very kind. I
don&#8217;t know what to do now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back to the hospital for the night. I will
send Henry de Spain up there just as soon as he
comes to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose Uncle Duke sees him first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that he doesn&#8217;t see him first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Uncle Duke to-night, do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lefever says he is up-street somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That means Tenison&#8217;s,&#8221; said Nan. &#8220;You
need not be afraid to speak plainly, as I must.
Uncle Duke is very angry&ndash;&ndash;I am deathly afraid
of their meeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even de Spain himself, when he came back the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
next night, seemed hardly able to reassure her.
Nan, who had stayed at the hospital, awaited
him there, whither Scott had directed him, with
her burden of anxiety still upon her. When she
had told all her story, de Spain laughed at her
fears. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring that man around, Nan, don&#8217;t
worry. Don&#8217;t believe we shall ever fight. I may
not be able to bring him around to-morrow, or
next week, but I&#8217;ll do it. It takes two to quarrel,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t know how unreasoning Uncle
Duke is when he is angry,&#8221; said Nan mournfully.
&#8220;He won&#8217;t listen to <i>any</i>body. He always would
listen to me until now. Now, he says, I have gone
back on him, and he doesn&#8217;t care what happens.
Think, Henry, where it would put me if either of
you should kill the other. Henry, I&#8217;ve been
thinking it all over for three days now. I see
what must come. It will break both our hearts,
I know, but they will be broken anyway. There
is no way out, Henry&ndash;&ndash;none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must give me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were sitting in the hospital garden, he
at her side on the bench that he called their
bench. It was here he had made his unrebuked
avowal&ndash;&ndash;here, he had afterward told her, that he
began to live. &#8220;Give you up,&#8221; he echoed with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
gentleness. &#8220;How could I do that? You&#8217;re like
the morning for me, Nan. Without you there&#8217;s
no day; you&#8217;re the kiss of the mountain wind and
the light of the stars to me. Without the thought
of you I&#8217;d sicken and faint in the saddle, I&#8217;d lose
my way in the hills; without you there would be
no to-morrow. No matter where I am, no matter
how I feel, if I think of you strength wells into
my heart like a spring. I never could give you
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He told her all would be well because it must be
well; that she <i>must</i> trust him; that he would bring
her safe through every danger and every storm, if
she would only stick to him. And Nan, sobbing
her fears one by one out on his breast, put her
arms around his neck and whispered that for life
or death, she <i>would</i> stick.</p>
<p>It was not hard for de Spain next morning to
find Duke Morgan. He was anxious on Nan&#8217;s
account to meet him early. The difficulty was
to meet him without the mob of hangers-on whose
appetite had been whetted with the prospect of
a death, and perhaps more than one, in the meeting
of men whose supremacy with the gun had
never been successfully disputed. It required all
the diplomacy of Lefever to &#8220;pull off&#8221; a conference
between the two which should not from the
start be hopeless, because of a crowd of Duke&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
partisans whose presence would egg him on, in
spite of everything, to a combat. But toward
eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning, de Spain having
been concealed like a circus performer every minute
earlier, Duke Morgan was found, alone, in a
barber&#8217;s hands in the Mountain House. At the
moment Duke left the revolving-chair and walked
to the cigar stand to pay his check, de Spain entered
the shop through the rear door opening from
the hotel office.</p>
<p>Passing with an easy step the row of barbers
lined up in waiting beside their chairs, de Spain
walked straight down the open aisle, behind
Morgan&#8217;s back. While Duke bent over the case
to select a cigar, de Spain, passing, placed himself
at the mountain-man&#8217;s side and between him and
the street sunshine. It was taking an advantage,
de Spain was well aware, but under the circumstances
he thought himself entitled to a good
light on Duke&#8217;s eye.</p>
<p>De Spain wore an ordinary sack street suit,
with no sign of a weapon about him; but none of
those who considered themselves favored spectators
of a long-awaited encounter felt any doubt
as to his ability to put his hand on one at incomparably
short notice. There was, however, no
trace of hostility or suspicion in de Spain&#8217;s greeting.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Duke Morgan,&#8221; he said frankly. Morgan
looked around. His face hardened when he
saw de Spain, and he involuntarily took a short
step backward. De Spain, with his left hand
lying carelessly on the cigar case, faced him. &#8220;I
heard you wanted to see me,&#8221; continued de Spain.
&#8220;I want to see you. How&#8217;s your back since you
went home?&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan eyed him with a mixture of suspicion
and animosity. He took what was to him the
most significant part of de Spain&#8217;s greeting first
and threw his response into words as short as
words could be chopped: &#8220;What do you want to
see me about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing unpleasant, I hope,&#8221; returned de
Spain. &#8220;Let&#8217;s sit down a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say what you got to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t take my head off, Duke. I was
sorry to hear you were hurt. And I&#8217;ve been trying
to figure out how to make it easier for you to
get to and from town while you are getting
strong. Jeffries and I both feel there&#8217;s been a
lot of unnecessary hard feeling between the Morgans
and the company, and we want to ask you
to accept this to show some of it&#8217;s ended.&#8221; De
Spain put his left hand into his side pocket and
held out an unsealed envelope to Morgan. Duke,
taking the envelope, eyed it distrustfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he demanded, opening it and
drawing out a card.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something for easier riding. An annual pass
for you and one over the stage line between Calabasas
and Sleepy Cat&ndash;&ndash;with Mr. Jeffries&#8217;s compliments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like a flash, Morgan tore the card pass in two
and threw it angrily to the floor. &#8220;Tell &#8216;Mr.&#8217;
Jeffries,&#8221; he exclaimed violently, &#8220;to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The man that chanced at that moment to be
lying in the nearest chair slid quietly but imperiously
out from under the razor and started with
the barbers for the rear door, wiping the lather
from one unshaven side of his face with a neck
towel as he took his hasty way. At the back of
the shop a fat man, sitting in a chair on the
high, shoe-shining platform, while a negro boy
polished him, rose at Morgan&#8217;s imprecation and
tried to step over the bootblack&#8217;s head to the
floor below. The boy, trying to get out of the
way, jumped back, and the fat man fell, or pretended
to fall, over him&ndash;&ndash;for it might be seen
that the man, despite his size, had lighted like a
cat on his feet and was instantly half-way up
to the front of the shop, exclaiming profanely
but collectedly at the lad&#8217;s awkwardness, before
de Spain had had time to reply to the insult.</p>
<p>The noise and confusion of the incident were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
considerable. Morgan was too old a fighter to
look behind him at a critical moment. No man
could say he had meant to draw when he stamped
the card underfoot, but de Spain read it in his
eye and knew that Lefever&#8217;s sudden diversion
at the rear had made him hesitate; the crisis
passed like a flash. &#8220;Sorry you feel that way,
Duke,&#8221; returned de Spain, undisturbed. &#8220;It is
a courtesy we were glad to extend. And I want
to speak to you about Nan, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan&#8217;s face was livid. &#8220;What about her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has given me permission to ask your consent
to our marriage,&#8221; said de Spain, &#8220;sometime
in the reasonable future.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was difficult for Duke to speak at all, he was
so infuriated. &#8220;You can get my consent in just
one way,&#8221; he managed to say, &#8220;that&#8217;s by getting
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll never get it, for I&#8217;ll never
&#8216;get&#8217; you, Duke.&#8221;</p>
<p>A torrent of oaths fell from Morgan&#8217;s cracked
lips. He tried to tell de Spain in his fury that he
knew all about his underhanded work, he called
him more than one hard name, made no secret
of his deadly enmity, and challenged him to end
their differences then and there.</p>
<p>De Spain did not move. His left hand again
lay on the cigar case. &#8220;Duke,&#8221; he said, when his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
antagonist had exhausted his vituperation, &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t fight you, anyway. You&#8217;re crazy angry
at me for no reason on earth. If you&#8217;ll give
me just one good reason for feeling the way you
do toward me, and the way you&#8217;ve always acted
toward me since I came up to this country, I&#8217;ll
fight you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull your gun,&#8221; cried Morgan with an imprecation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do it. You call me a coward. Ask
these boys here in the shop whether they agree
with you on that. You might as well call me an
isosceles triangle. You&#8217;re just crazy sore at me
when I want to be friends with you. Instead of
pulling my gun, Duke, I&#8217;ll lay it out on the case,
here, to show you that all I ask of you is to talk
reason.&#8221; De Spain, reaching with his left hand
under the lapel of his coat, took a Colt&#8217;s revolver
from its breast harness and laid it, the muzzle
toward himself, on the plate-glass top of the
cigar stand. It reduced him to the necessity of
a spring into Morgan for the smallest chance for
his life if Morgan should draw; but de Spain was
a desperate gambler in such matters even at
twenty-eight, and he laid his wagers on what he
could read in another&#8217;s eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s more reasons than one why I shouldn&#8217;t
fight you,&#8221; he said evenly. &#8220;Duke, you&#8217;re old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
enough to be my father&ndash;&ndash;do you realize that?
What&#8217;s the good of our shooting each other up?&#8221;
he asked, ignoring Morgan&#8217;s furious interruptions.
&#8220;Who&#8217;s to look after Nan when you go&ndash;&ndash;as
you must, before very many years? Have
you ever asked yourself that? Do you want to
leave her to that pack of wolves in the Gap?
You know, just as well as I do, the Gap is no
place for a high-bred, fine-grained girl like Nan
Morgan. But the Gap is your home, and you&#8217;ve
done right to keep her under your roof and under
your eye. Do you think <i>I&#8217;d</i> like to pull a trigger
on a man that&#8217;s been a father to Nan? Damnation,
Duke, could you expect me to do it, willingly?
Nan is a queen. The best in the world isn&#8217;t good
enough for her&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m not good enough, I know
that. She&#8217;s dear to you, she is dear to me. If
you really want to see me try to use a gun, send
me a man that will insult or abuse her. If you
want to use your own gun, use it on me if I ever
insult or abuse her&ndash;&ndash;is that fair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn your fine words,&#8221; exclaimed Morgan
slowly and implacably. &#8220;They don&#8217;t pull any
wool over my eyes. I know you, de Spain&ndash;&ndash;I
know your breed&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan checked himself at that tone. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t sneak into my affairs any deeper,&#8221; he cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
&#8220;Keep away from my blood! I know how to
take care of my own. I&#8217;ll do it. So help me
God, if you ever take any one of my kin away
from me&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;ll be over my dead body!&#8221; He ended
with a bitter oath and a final taunt: &#8220;Is that
fair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; retorted de Spain good-naturedly, &#8220;it&#8217;s
not fair. And some day, Duke, you&#8217;ll be the
first to say so. You won&#8217;t shake hands with me
now, I know, so I&#8217;ll go. But the day will come
when you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>He covered his revolver with his left hand, and
replaced it under his coat. The fat man who had
been leaning patiently against a barber&#8217;s chair
ten feet from the disputants, stepped forward
again lightly as a cat. &#8220;Henry,&#8221; he exclaimed, in
a low but urgent tone, his hand extended, &#8220;just
a minute. There&#8217;s a long-distance telephone call
on the wire for you.&#8221; He pointed to the office
door. &#8220;Take the first booth, Henry. Hello,
Duke,&#8221; he added, greeting Morgan with an extended
hand, as de Spain walked back. &#8220;How
are you making it, old man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Duke Morgan grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to interrupt your talk,&#8221; continued Lefever.
&#8220;But the barns at Calabasas are burning&ndash;&ndash;telephone
wires from there cut, too&ndash;&ndash;they had
to pick up the Thief River trunk line to get a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
message through. Makes it bad, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
Lefever pulled a wry face. &#8220;Duke, there&#8217;s somebody
yet around Calabasas that needs hanging,
isn&#8217;t there? Yes.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>GALE PERSISTS</h3>
</div>
<p>When within an hour de Spain joined Nan,
tense with suspense and anxiety, at the
hospital, she tried hard to read his news in his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen him?&#8221; she asked eagerly. De
Spain nodded. &#8220;What does he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing very reasonable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face fell. &#8220;I knew he wouldn&#8217;t. Tell me
all about it, Henry&ndash;&ndash;everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>She listened keenly to each word. De Spain
gave her a pretty accurate recital of the interview,
and Nan&#8217;s apprehension grew with her
hearing of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; she repeated with conviction. &#8220;I
know him better than you know him. <i>What</i> shall
we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain took both her hands. He held them
against his breast and stood looking into her eyes.
When he regarded her in such a way her doubts
and fears seemed mean and trivial. He spoke
only one word, but there was a world of confidence
in his tone: &#8220;Stick.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>She arched her brows as she returned his gaze,
and with a little troubled laugh drew closer.
&#8220;Stick, Nan,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;It will come out
all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused a moment. &#8220;How can you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know because it&#8217;s got to. I talked it all
over with my best friend in Medicine Bend, the
other day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who, Henry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whispering Smith. He laughed at your
uncle&#8217;s opposing us. He said if your uncle only
knew it, it&#8217;s the best thing that could happen for
him. And he said if all the marriages opposed
by old folks had been stopped, there wouldn&#8217;t be
young folks enough left to milk the cows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry, what is this report about the Calabasas
barns burning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The old Number One barn is gone and some
of the old stages. We didn&#8217;t lose any horses,
and the other barns are all right. Some of our
Calabasas or Gap friends, probably. No matter,
we&#8217;ll get them all rounded up after a while, Nan.
Then, some fine day, we&#8217;re going to get married.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain rode that night to Calabasas to look
into the story of the fire.</p>
<p>McAlpin, swathed in bandages, made no bones
about accusing the common enemy. No witnesses
could be found to throw any more light on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
the inquiry than the barn boss himself. And de
Spain made only a pretense of a formal investigation.
If he had had any doubts about the origin
of the fire they would have been resolved by an
anonymous scrawl, sent through the mail, promising
more if he didn&#8217;t get out of the country.</p>
<p>But instead of getting out of the country, de
Spain continued as a matter of energetic policy
to get into it. He rode the deserts stripped, so
to say, for action and walked the streets of Sleepy
Cat welcoming every chance to meet men from
Music Mountain or the Sinks. It was on Nan
that the real hardships of the situation fell, and
Nan who had to bear them alone and almost
unaided.</p>
<p>Duke came home a day or two later without a
word for Nan concerning his encounter with de
Spain. He was shorter in the grain than ever,
crustier to every one than she had ever known
him&ndash;&ndash;and toward Nan herself fiercely resentful.
Sassoon was in his company a great deal, and
Nan knew of old that Sassoon was a bad symptom.
Gale, too, came often, and the three were much
together. In some way, Nan felt that she herself
was in part the subject of their talks, but no
information concerning them could she ever get.</p>
<p>One morning she sat on the porch sewing when
Gale rode up. He asked for her uncle. Bonita
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
told him Duke had gone to Calabasas. Gale announced
he was bound for Calabasas himself, and
dismounted near Nan, professedly to cinch his
saddle. He fussed with the straps for a minute,
trying to engage Nan in the interval, without success,
in conversation. &#8220;Look here, Nan,&#8221; he
said at length, studiously amiable, &#8220;don&#8217;t you
think you&#8217;re pretty hard on me, lately?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;If Uncle Duke
didn&#8217;t make me, I&#8217;d never look at you, or speak to
you&ndash;&ndash;or live in the same mountains with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think when a fellow cares for you as
much as I do, and gets out of patience once in a
while, just because he loves a girl the way a red-blooded
man can&#8217;t help loving her, she ought
to hold it against him forever. Think she ought
to, Nan?&#8221; he demanded after a pause. She was
sewing and had kept silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; she responded, showing her aversion
in every syllable, &#8220;before a man begins to talk
red-blood rot, he ought to find out whether the
girl cares for him, or just loathes the sight of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He regarded her fixedly. Paying no attention
to him, but bending in the sunshine over her sewing,
her hand flying with the needle, her masses
of brown hair sweeping back around her pink ears
and curling in stray ringlets that the wind danced
with while she worked, she inflamed her brawny
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
cousin&#8217;s ardor afresh. &#8220;You used to care for me,
Nan. You can&#8217;t deny that.&#8221; Her silence was
irritating. &#8220;Can you?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Come,
put up your work and talk it out. I didn&#8217;t use
to have to coax you for a word and a smile.
What&#8217;s come over you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing has come over me, Gale. I did use
to like you&ndash;&ndash;when I first came back from school.
You seemed so big and fine then, and were so nice
to me. I did like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you keep on liking me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan made no answer. Her cousin persisted.
&#8220;You used to talk about thinking the world of
me,&#8221; she said at last; &#8220;then I saw you one Frontier
Day, riding around Sleepy Cat with a carriage
full of women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gale burst into a huge laugh. Nan&#8217;s face
flushed. She bent over her work. &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s
what&#8217;s the matter with you, is it?&#8221; he demanded
jocularly. &#8220;You never mentioned <i>that</i> before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t the only thing,&#8221; she continued
after a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that was just some Frontier Day fun,
Nan. A man&#8217;s got to be a little bit of a sport
once in a while, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if he likes me.&#8221; She spoke with an ominous
distinctness, but under her breath. He
caught her words and laughed again. &#8220;Pshaw, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d get jealous over a little thing
like that, Nan. When there&#8217;s a celebration on in
town, everybody&#8217;s friendly with everybody else.
If you lay a little thing like that up against me,
where would the rest of the men get off? Your
strawberry-faced Medicine Bend friend is celebrating
in town most of the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face turned white. &#8220;What a falsehood!&#8221;
she exclaimed hotly. Looking at her, satisfied, he
laughed whole-heartedly again. She rose, furious.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a falsehood,&#8221; she repeated, &#8220;and I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; retorted Gale, regarding her jocosely,
&#8220;you asked him about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had never seen her so angry. She stamped
her foot. &#8220;How dare you say such a thing!
One of those women was at the hospital&ndash;&ndash;she is
there yet, and she is going to die there. She told
Uncle Duke&#8217;s nurse the men they knew, and
whom they didn&#8217;t know, at that place. And
Henry de Spain, when he heard this miserable
creature had been taken to the hospital, and
Doctor Torpy said she could never get well, told
the Sister to take care of her and send the bills
to him, because he knew her father and mother
in Medicine Bend and went to school with her
there when she was a decent girl. Go and hear
what <i>she</i> has to say about Henry de Spain, you
contemptible falsifier.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></div>
<p>Gale laughed sardonically. &#8220;That&#8217;s right. I
like to see a girl stick to her friends. De Spain
ought to take care of her. Good story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she has other good stories, too, you ought
to hear,&#8221; continued Nan undismayed. &#8220;Most
of them about you and your fine friends in town.
She told the nurse it&#8217;s <i>you</i> who ought to be paying
her bills till she dies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gale made a disclaiming face and a deprecating
gesture. &#8220;No, no, Nan&ndash;&ndash;let de Spain take care of
his own. Be a sport yourself, girlie, right now.&#8221;
He stepped nearer her. Nan retreated. &#8220;Kiss
and make up,&#8221; he exclaimed with a laugh. But
she knew he was angry, and knew what to guard
against. Still laughing, he sprang toward her
and tried to catch her arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me!&#8221; she cried, jumping away
with her hand in her blouse.</p>
<p>&#8220;You little vixen,&#8221; he exclaimed with an
oath, &#8220;what have you got there?&#8221; But he
halted at her gesture, and Nan, panting, stood
her ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep away!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get that knife?&#8221; thundered
Gale.</p>
<p>&#8220;From one who showed me how to use it on a
coward!&#8221;</p>
<p>He affected amusement and tried to pass the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
incident off as a joke. But his dissimulation was
more dangerous, she knew, than his brutality,
and he left her the prey to more than one alarm
and the renewed resolve never to be taken off her
guard. That night he came back. He told her
uncle, glancing admiringly at Nan as he recounted
the story, how she had stood her ground
against him in the morning.</p>
<p>Nor did Nan like the way her uncle acted while
he listened&ndash;&ndash;and afterward. He talked a good
deal about Gale and the way she was treating her
cousin. When Nan declared she never would
have anything to do with him, her uncle told her
with disconcerting bluntness to get all that out
of her head, for she was going to marry him.
When she protested she never would, Duke told
her, with many harsh oaths, that she should never
marry de Spain even if he had to kill him or get
killed to stop it, and that if she had any sense she
would get ready to marry her cousin peaceably,
adding, that if she didn&#8217;t have sense, he would see
himself it was provided for her.</p>
<p>His threats left Nan aghast. For two days she
thought them all over. Then she dressed to go
to town. On her way to the barn her uncle intercepted
her. &#8220;Where you going?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To Sleepy Cat,&#8221; returned Nan, regarding
him collectedly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not,&#8221; he announced bluntly.</p>
<p>Nan looked at him in silence. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
you running to town any more to meet de Spain,&#8221;
added Duke, without any attempt to soften his
injunction.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to go to town once in a while,
whether I meet Henry de Spain or not, Uncle
Duke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you have to go for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, for mail, supplies&ndash;&ndash;everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardaloe can attend to all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nan shook her head. &#8220;Whether he can or not,
I&#8217;m not going to be cut off from going to Sleepy
Cat, Uncle Duke&ndash;&ndash;nor from seeing Henry de
Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning to say you won&#8217;t obey, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;m going to marry a man it isn&#8217;t right
to forbid me seeing him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to marry him; you&#8217;re going
to marry Gale, and the quicker you make up your
mind to it the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might better tell me I am going to marry
Bull Page&ndash;&ndash;I would marry him first. I will never
marry Gale Morgan in the living world, and I&#8217;ve
told you so more than once.&#8221;</p>
<p>He regarded his niece a moment wrathfully
and, without replying, walked back to the house.
Nan, upset but resolute, went on to the barn and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
asked Pardaloe to saddle her pony. Pardaloe
shuffled around in an obliging way, but at the
end of some evasion admitted he had orders not
to do it. Nan flamed at the information. She
disliked Pardaloe anyway, not for any reason she
could assign beyond the fact that he had once
been a chum of Gale&#8217;s. But she was too high-spirited
to dispute with him, and returned to the
house pink with indignation. Going straight to her
uncle, she protested against such tyranny. Duke
was insensible alike to her pleas and her threats.</p>
<p>But next morning Nan was up at three o&#8217;clock.
She made her way into the barn before a soul was
stirring, and at daybreak was well on her way to
Sleepy Cat. She telephoned to de Spain&#8217;s office
from the hospital and went to breakfast. De
Spain joined her before she had finished, and when
they left the dining-room she explained why she
had disappointed him the day before. He heard
the story with misgivings.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you how it looks to me, Nan,&#8221; he said
when she had done. &#8220;You are like a person
that&#8217;s being bound tighter every day by invisible
cords. You don&#8217;t see them because you are fearless.
You are too fearless, Nan,&#8221; he added, with
apprehension reflected in the expression of his
face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I wish you&#8217;d do, and I
say it knowing you won&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he concluded.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>She made light of his fears, twisting his right
hand till it was helpless in her two hands and
laughing at him. &#8220;How do you know I won&#8217;t
do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve asked you before. This is it:
marry me, now, here, to-day, and don&#8217;t take any
more chances out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Henry,&#8221; protested Nan, &#8220;I can&#8217;t marry
you now and just run away from poor Uncle
Duke. If you will just be patient, I&#8217;ll bring him
around to our side.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so sure. I know him better than
you do, and when he comes for anybody, he comes
all at once. Why, it&#8217;s funny, Henry. Now that
I&#8217;m picking up courage, you&#8217;re losing it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the way
things are going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearie,&#8221; she urged, &#8220;should I be any safer
at home if I were your wife, than I am as your
sweetheart. I don&#8217;t want to start a horrible family
war by running away, and that is just what
I certainly should do.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain was unconvinced. But apprehension
is short-lived in young hearts. The sun shone,
the sky spread a speckless blue over desert and
mountain, the day was for them together. They
did not promise all of it to themselves at once&ndash;&ndash;they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
filched its sweetness bit by bit, moment by
moment, and hour by hour, declaring to each other
they must part, and dulling the pain of parting
with the anodyne of procrastination. Thus, the
whole day went to their castles and dreams. In
a retired corner of the cool dining-room at the
Mountain House, they lingered together over
a long-drawn-out dinner. The better-informed
guests by asides indicated their presence to others.
They described them as the hardy couple who had
first met in a stiff Frontier Day rifle match, which
the girl had won. Her defeated rival&ndash;&ndash;the man
now most regarded and feared in the mountain
country&ndash;&ndash;was the man with the reticent mouth,
mild eyes, curious birthmark, and with the two
little, perplexed wrinkles visible most of the time
just between his dark eyebrows, the man listening
intently to every syllable that fell from the lips
of the trimly bloused, active girl opposite him,
leaning forward in her eagerness to tell him things.
Her jacket hung over the back of her chair, and
she herself was referred to by the more fanciful as
queen of the outlaw camp at Music Mountain.</p>
<p>They two were seen together that day about
town by many, for the story of their courtship
was still veiled in mystery and afforded ground
for the widest speculation, while that of their
difficulties, and such particulars as de Spain&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
fruitless efforts to conciliate Duke Morgan and
Duke&#8217;s open threats against de Spain&#8217;s life were
widely known. All these details made the movement
and the fate of the young couple the object
of keenly curious comment.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon the two rode almost the
whole length of Main Street together on their
way to the river bridge. Every one knew the
horseflesh they bestrode&ndash;&ndash;none cleaner-limbed,
hardier, or faster in the high country. Those
that watched them amble slowly past, laughing
and talking, intent only on each other, erect,
poised, and motionless, as if moulded to their
saddles, often spoke of having seen Nan and her
lover that day. It was a long time before they
were seen riding down Main Street together again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>DE SPAIN WORRIES</h3>
</div>
<p>They parted that evening under the shadow
of Music Mountain. Nan believed she could
at least win her Uncle Duke over from any effort
of Gale&#8217;s to coerce her. Her influence over her
uncle had never yet failed, and she was firm in
the conviction she could gain him to her side,
since he had everything to win and nothing to
lose by siding against Gale, whom he disliked and
distrusted, anyway.</p>
<p>For de Spain there was manifestly nothing to
do but doubtfully to let Nan try out her influence.
They agreed to meet in Calabasas just as
soon as Nan could get away. She hoped, she
told him, to bring good news. De Spain arranged
his business to wait at Calabasas for her, and was
there, after two days, doing little but waiting and
listening to McAlpin&#8217;s stories about the fire and
surmises as to strange men that lurked in and
about the place. But de Spain, knowing Jeffries
was making an independent investigation into
the affair, gave no heed to McAlpin&#8217;s suspicions.</p>
<p>To get away from the barn boss, de Spain took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
refuge in riding. The season was drawing on
toward winter, and rain clouds drifting at intervals
down from the mountains made the saddle a
less dependable escape from the monotony of
Calabasas. Several days passed with no sight of
Nan and no word from her. De Spain, as the
hours and days went by, scanned the horizon with
increasing solicitude. When he woke on the
sixth morning, he was resolved to send a scout
into the Gap to learn what he could of the situation.
The long silence, de Spain knew, portended
nothing good. And the vexing feature of
his predicament was that he had at hand no
trustworthy spy to despatch for information; to
secure one would be a matter of delay. He was
schooled, however, to making use of such material
as he had at hand, and when he had made up his
mind, he sent to the stable for Bull Page.</p>
<p>The shambling barn man, summoned gruffly by
McAlpin, hesitated as he appeared at the office
door and seemed to regard the situation with
suspicion. He looked at de Spain tentatively, as
if ready either for the discharge with which he
was daily threatened or for a renewal of his
earlier, friendly relations with the man who had
been queer enough to make a place for him. De
Spain set Bull down before him in the stuffy
little office.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Bull,&#8221; he began with apparent frankness, &#8220;I
want to know how you like your job.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiping his mouth guardedly with his hand to
play for time and as an introduction to a carefully
worded reply, Bull parried. &#8220;Mr. de Spain,
I want to ask you just one fair question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Bull.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull plunged promptly into the suspicion uppermost
in his mind. &#8220;Has that slat-eyed, flat-headed,
sun-sapped sneak of a Scotchman been
complaining of my work? <i>That</i>, Mr. de Spain,&#8221;
emphasized Bull, leaning forward, &#8220;is what I
want to know first&ndash;&ndash;is it a fair question?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bull,&#8221; returned de Spain with corresponding
and ceremonial emphasis, &#8220;it is a fair question
between man and man. I admit it; it is a fair
question. And I answer, no, Bull. McAlpin has
had nothing on the face of the desert to do with
my sending for you. And I add this because I
know you want to hear it: he says he couldn&#8217;t
complain of your work, because you never do
any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That man,&#8221; persisted Bull, reinforced by the
hearty tone and not clearly catching the drift of
the very last words, &#8220;drinks more liquor than I
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be some tank, Bull.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t hide it, Mr. de Spain.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have to crawl under Music Mountain
to do that. What I want to know is, do you like
your job?&#8221;</p>
<p>On this point it was impossible to get an expression
from Bull. He felt convinced that de
Spain was pressing for an answer only as a preliminary
to his discharge. &#8220;No matter,&#8221; interposed
the latter, cutting Bull&#8217;s ramblings short,
&#8220;drop it, Bull. I want you to do something for
me, and I&#8217;ll pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull, with a palsied smile and a deep, quavering
note of gratitude, put up his shaky hand.
&#8220;Say what. That&#8217;s all. I&#8217;ve been paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know you&#8217;re a sot, Bull.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull nodded. &#8220;I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A disgrace to the Maker whose image you
were made in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull started, but seemed, on reflection, to consider
this a point on which he need not commit
himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still, I believe there&#8217;s a man in you yet.
Something, at any rate, you couldn&#8217;t completely
kill with whiskey, Bull&ndash;&ndash;what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull lifted his weak and watery eyes. His
whiskey-seamed face brightened into the ghost of
a smile. &#8220;What I&#8217;m going to ask you to do,&#8221;
continued de Spain, &#8220;is a man&#8217;s job. You can
get into the Gap without trouble. You are the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
only man I can put my hand on just now, that
can. I want you to ride over this morning and
hang out around Duke Morgan&#8217;s place till you
can get a chance to see Miss Nan&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>At the mention of her name, Bull shook his
head a moment in affirmative approval. &#8220;She&#8217;s
a queen!&#8221; he exclaimed with admiring but pungent
expletives. &#8220;A queen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so, Bull. But she is in troublesome
circumstances. You know Nan and I&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull winked in many ways.</p>
<p>&#8220;And her Uncle Duke is making us trouble,
Bull. I want you to find her, speak with her,
and bring word to me as to what the situation is.
That doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re to get drunk over there&ndash;&ndash;in
fact, I don&#8217;t think anybody over there would
give you a drink&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t believe they would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are to ride back here with what you
can find out just as quick, after you get into the
clear, as a horse will bring you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull passed his hand over his mouth with a
show of resolution. It indicated that he was pulling
himself together. Within half an hour he was
on his way to the Gap.</p>
<p>For de Spain hours never dragged as did the
hours between his starting and the setting of the
sun that night without his return. And the sun
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
set behind Music Mountain in a drift of heavy
clouds that brought rain. All evening it fell
steadily. At eleven o&#8217;clock de Spain had given
up hope of seeing his emissary before morning
and was sitting alone before the stove in the office
when he heard the sound of hoofs. In another
moment Bull Page stood at the door.</p>
<p>He was a sorry sight. Soaked to the skin by
the steady downpour; rain dripping intermittently
from his frayed hat, his ragged beard, and tattered
coat; shaking with the cold as if gripped by an
ague, Bull, picking his staggering steps to the fire,
and sinking in a heap into a chair, symbolized
the uttermost tribute of manhood to the ravages
of whiskey. He was not drunk. He had not even
been drinking; but his vitality was gone. He
tried to speak. It was impossible. His tongue
would not frame words, nor his throat utter them.
He could only look helplessly at de Spain as de
Spain hastily made him stand up on his shaking
knees, threw a big blanket around him, sat him
down, kicked open the stove drafts, and called to
McAlpin for more whiskey to steady the wreck of
it crouching over the fire.</p>
<p>McAlpin after considerable and reluctant search
produced a bottle, and unwilling, for more reasons
than one, to trust it to Bull&#8217;s uncertain possession,
brought a dipper. Bull held the dipper while de
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
Spain poured. McAlpin, behind the stove, hopped
first on one foot and then on the other as de Spain
recklessly continued to pour. When the liquor
half filled the cup, McAlpin put out unmistakable
distress signals, but Bull, watching the brown
stream, his eyes galvanized at the sight, held fast
to the handle and made no sign to stop. &#8220;Bull!&#8221;
thundered the barn boss with an emphatic word.
&#8220;That is Elpaso&#8217;s bottle. What are you dreaming
of, man? Mr. de Spain, you&#8217;ll kill him. Don&#8217;t
ye see he can&#8217;t tell ye to stop?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bull, with the last flickering spark of vitality
still left within him, looked steadily up and winked
at de Spain. McAlpin, outraged, stamped out
of the room. Steadying the dipper in both hands,
Bull with an effort passed one hand at the final
moment preliminarily over his mouth, and, raising
the bowl, emptied it. The poison electrified him
into utterance. &#8220;I seen her,&#8221; he declared, holding
his chin well down and in, and speaking in a pardonably
proud throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, Bull!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got things tied up for fair over there.&#8221;
He spoke slowly and brokenly. &#8220;I never got inside
the house till after supper. Toward night
I helped Pardaloe put up the stock. He let me
into the kitchen after my coaxing for a cup of
coffee&ndash;&ndash;he&#8217;s an ornery, cold-blooded guy, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
Pardaloe. Old Duke and Sassoon think the sun
rises and sets on the top of his head&ndash;&ndash;funny,
ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain made no comment. &#8220;Whilst I was
drinking my coffee&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who gave it to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Bunny, the Mex. Pardaloe goes out to
the bunk-house; I sits down to my supper, alone,
with Bunny at the stove. All of a sudden who
comes a-trippin&#8217; in from the front of the house
but Nan. I jumped up as strong as I could, but
I was too cold and stiff to jump up real strong.
She seen me, but didn&#8217;t pay no attention. I
dropped my spoon on the floor. It didn&#8217;t do no
good, neither, so I pushed a hot plate of ham
gravy off the table. It hit the dog &#8217;n&#8217; he jumped
like kingdom come. Old Bunny sails into me,
Nan a-watchin&#8217;, and while Mex was pickin&#8217; up
and cleanin&#8217; up, I sneaks over to the stove and
winks at Nan. Say, you oughter seen her look
mad at me. She was hot, but I kept a-winkin&#8217;
and I says to her kind of husky-like: &#8216;Got any
letters for Calabasas to-night?&#8217; Say, she looked
at me as if she&#8217;d bore holes into me, but I stood
right up and glared back at the little girl. &#8216;Come
from there this mornin&#8217;,&#8217; says I, low, &#8216;going back
to-night. Some one waiting there for news.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;By jing! Just as I got the words out o&#8217; my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
mouth who comes a-stalking in but Gale Morgan.
The minute he seen me, he lit on me to beat the
band&ndash;&ndash;called me everything he could lay his
tongue to. I let on I was drunk, but that didn&#8217;t
help. He ordered me off the premises. &#8217;N&#8217; the
worst of it was, Nan chimed right in and began
to scold Bunny for lettin&#8217; me in&ndash;&ndash;and leaves the
room, quick-like. Bunny put it on Pardaloe, and
she and Gale had it, and b&#8217;jing, Gale put me out&ndash;&ndash;said
he&#8217;d pepper me. But wait till I tell y&#8217;
how she fooled him. It was rainin&#8217; like hell, &#8217;n&#8217;
it looked as if I was booked for a ride through it
and hadn&#8217;t half drunk my second cup of coffee
at that. I starts for the barn, when some one in
the dark on the porch grabs my arm, spins me
around like a top, throws a flasher up into my
face, and there was Nan. &#8216;Bull,&#8217; she says, &#8216;I&#8217;m
sorry. I don&#8217;t want to see you ride out in this
with nothing to eat; come this way quick.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She took me down cellar from the outside,
under the kitchen. When Gale goes out again
she flings up the trap-door, speaks to Mex, pulls
all the kitchen shades down, locks the doors, and
I sets down on the trap-door steps &#8217;n&#8217; eats a pipin&#8217;
hot supper; say! Well, I reckon I drank a couple
o&#8217; quarts of coffee. &#8216;Bull,&#8217; she says, &#8216;I never
done you no harm, did I?&#8217; &#8216;Never,&#8217; says I,
&#8216;and I never done you none, neither, did I? And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
what&#8217;s more, I never will do you none.&#8217; Then I
up and told her. &#8216;Tell him,&#8217; says she, &#8216;I can&#8217;t
get hold of a horse, nor a pen, nor a piece of paper&ndash;&ndash;I
can&#8217;t leave the house but what I am watched
every minute. They keep track of me day and
night. Tell him,&#8217; she says, &#8216;I can protect myself;
they think they&#8217;ll break me&ndash;&ndash;make me do what
they want me to&ndash;&ndash;marry&ndash;&ndash;but they can&#8217;t break
me, and I&#8217;ll never do it&ndash;&ndash;tell him that.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;But,&#8217; says I, &#8216;that ain&#8217;t the whole case, Miss
Nan. What he&#8217;ll ask me, when he&#8217;s borin&#8217;
through me with <i>his</i> eyes like the way you&#8217;re
borin&#8217; me through with yours, is: When will you
see him&ndash;&ndash;when will he see you?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;She looked worrit for a minit. Then she
looks around, grabs up the cover of an empty
&#8217;bacco box and a fork and begins a-writing inside.&#8221;
Bull, with as much of a smile as he could
call into life from his broken nerves, opened up
his blanket, drew carefully from an inside coat
pocket an oilskin package, unwrapped from it the
flat, square top of a tin tobacco box on which
Nan had scratched a message, and handed it
triumphantly to de Spain.</p>
<p>He read her words eagerly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait; don&#8217;t have trouble. I can stand anything
better than bloodshed, Henry. Be patient.&#8221;</p>
<p>While de Spain, standing close to the lantern,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
deciphered the brief note, Bull, wrapping his
blanket about him with the air of one whose responsibility
is well ended, held out his hands
toward the blazing stove. De Spain went over
the words one by one, and the letters again and
again. It was, after all their months of ardent
meetings, the first written message he had ever
had from Nan. He flamed angrily at the news
that she was prisoner in her own home. But
there was much to weigh in her etched words,
much to think about concerning her feelings&ndash;&ndash;not
alone concerning his own.</p>
<p>He dropped into his chair and, oblivious for a
moment of his companion&#8217;s presence, stared into
the fire. When he started from his revery Bull
was asleep. De Spain picked him up, carried him
in his blanket over to a cot, cut the wet rags off
him, and, rolling him in a second blanket, walked
out into the barn and ordered up a team and light
wagon for Sleepy Cat. The rain fell all night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>AN OMINOUS MESSAGE</h3>
</div>
<p>Few men bear suspense well; de Spain took
his turn at it very hard. For the first time
in his life he found himself braved by men of a
type whose defiance he despised&ndash;&ndash;whose lawlessness
he ordinarily warred on without compunction&ndash;&ndash;but
himself without the freedom that had
always been his to act. Every impulse to take
the bit in his teeth was met with the same insurmountable
obstacle&ndash;&ndash;Nan&#8217;s feelings&ndash;&ndash;and the unpleasant
possibility that might involve him in
bloodshed with her kinspeople.</p>
<p>&#8220;Patience.&#8221; He repeated the word to himself
a thousand times to deaden his suspense and apprehension.
Business affairs took much of his
time, but Nan&#8217;s situation took most of his thought.
For the first time he told John Lefever the story
of Nan&#8217;s finding him on Music Mountain, of her
aid in his escape, and the sequel of their friendship.
Lefever gave it to Bob Scott in Jeffries&#8217;s
office.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did I tell you, John?&#8221; demanded Bob
mildly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No matter what you told me,&#8221; retorted Lefever.
&#8220;The question is: What&#8217;s he to do to get
Nan away from there without shooting up the
Morgans?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain had gone that morning to Medicine
Bend. He got back late and, after a supper at
the Mountain House, went directly to his room.</p>
<p>The telephone-bell was ringing when he unlocked
and threw open his door. Entering the
room, he turned on a light, closed the door behind
him, and sat down to answer the call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this Henry de Spain?&#8221; came a voice, slowly
pronouncing the words over the wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a message for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From Music Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The message is like this: &#8216;Take me away from
here as soon as you can.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whom is that message from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t call any names.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I say. Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on. Where are you talking from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About a block from your office.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Do you think it a fair way to treat a man
to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to be fair to myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me the message again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Take me away from here as soon as you can.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does it come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Music Mountain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re treating me fair&ndash;&ndash;and I believe you
mean to&ndash;&ndash;come over to my room a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me come to where you are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me wait for you&ndash;&ndash;anywhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know I was in town to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you get off the train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were looking for me, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To deliver my message.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that message means what it
says?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what it means for me to undertake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a pretty stiff idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get it direct from the party who
sent it?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t talk all night. Take it or leave it
just where it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain heard him close. He closed his own
instrument and began feverishly signalling central.
&#8220;This is 101. Henry de Spain talking,&#8221; he
said briskly. &#8220;You just called me. Ten dollars
for you, operator, if you can locate that call,
quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment of delay at the central
office, then the answer: &#8220;It came from 234&ndash;&ndash;Tenison&#8217;s
saloon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me your name, operator. Good. Now
give me 22 as quick as the Lord will let you, and
ring the neck off the bell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever answered the call on number 22. The
talk was quick and sharp. Messengers were instantly
pressed into service from the despatcher&#8217;s
office. Telephone wires hummed, and every man
available on the special agent&#8217;s force was brought
into action. Livery-stables were covered, the
public resorts were put under observation, horsemen
clattered up and down the street. Within
an incredibly short time the town was rounded
up, every outgoing trail watched, and search was
under way for any one from Morgan&#8217;s Gap, and
especially for the sender of the telephone message.</p>
<p>De Spain, after instructing Lefever, hastened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
to Tenison&#8217;s. His rapid questioning of the few
habitu&eacute;s of the place and the bartender elicited only
the information that a man had used the telephone booth
within a few minutes. Nobody knew him
or, if they did know him, refused to describe him
in any but vague terms. He had come in by the
front door and slipped out probably by the rear
door&ndash;&ndash;at all events, unnoticed by those questioned.
By a series of eliminating inquiries, de Spain
made out only that the man was not a Morgan.
Outside, Bob Scott in the saddle waited with a
led horse. The two men rode straight and hard
for the river bridge. They roused an old hunter
who lived in a near-by hut, on the town side, and
asked whether any horseman had crossed the
bridge. The hunter admitted gruffly that he <i>had</i>
heard a horse&#8217;s hoof recently on the bridge.
Within how long? The hunter, after taking a
full precious minute to decide, said thirty minutes;
moreover, he insisted that the horseman he had
heard had ridden into town, and not out.</p>
<p>Sceptical of the correctness of the information,
Scott and de Spain clattered out on the Sinks.
Their horseflesh was good and they felt they
could overtake any man not suspecting pursuit.
The sky was overcast, and speed was their only
resource. After two miles of riding, the pursuers
reined up on a ridge, and Scott, springing from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
saddle, listened for sounds. He rose from the
ground, declaring he could hear the strides of a
running horse. Again the two dashed ahead.</p>
<p>The chase was bootless. Whoever rode before
them easily eluded pursuit. The next time the
scout dropped from his saddle to listen, not the
faintest sound rewarded his attention. De Spain
was impatient. &#8220;He could easily slip us,&#8221; Scott
explained, &#8220;by leaving the trail for a minute
while we rode past&ndash;&ndash;if he knows his business&ndash;&ndash;and
I guess he does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the old man was right, that man could have
ridden in town and out, too, within half to three-quarters
of an hour,&#8221; said de Spain. &#8220;But how
could he have got out without being heard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; suggested Scott, &#8220;he forded the
river.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could he do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s job,&#8221; returned Scott, reflecting,
&#8220;but it could be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If a man thought it necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he knew you by sight,&#8221; responded Scott
unmoved, &#8220;he might have thought it necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Undeterred by his failure to overtake the fugitive,
de Spain rode rapidly back to town to look
for other clews. Nothing further was found to
throw light on the message or messenger. No
one had been found anywhere in town from Morgan&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
Gap; whoever had taken a chance in delivering
the message had escaped undetected.</p>
<p>Even after the search had been abandoned the
significance of the incident remained to be weighed.
De Spain was much upset. A conference with
Scott, whose judgment in any affair was marked
by good sense, and with Lefever, who, like a
woman, reached by intuition a conclusion at
which Scott or de Spain arrived by process of
thought, only revealed the fact that all three,
as Lefever confessed, were nonplussed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of two things,&#8221; declared Lefever,
whose eyes were never dulled by late hours.
&#8220;Either they&#8217;ve sent this to lure you into the Gap
and &#8216;get&#8217; you, or else&ndash;&ndash;and that&#8217;s a great big &#8216;or
else&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;she needs you. Henry, did that message&ndash;&ndash;I
mean the way it was worded&ndash;&ndash;sound like Nan
Morgan?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain could hardly answer. &#8220;It did, and
it didn&#8217;t,&#8221; he said finally. &#8220;But&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; his companions
saw during the pause by which his lips
expressed the resolve he had finally reached that
he was not likely to be turned from it&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;I am
going to act just as if the word came from Nan
and she does need me.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than one scheme for getting quickly into
touch with Nan was proposed and rejected within
the next ten minutes. And when Lefever, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
conferring with Scott, put up to de Spain a proposal
that the three should ride into the Gap
together and demand Nan at the hands of Duke
Morgan, de Spain had reached another conclusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you are willing to take more than your
share, John, of any game I play. In the first
place it isn&#8217;t right to take you and Bob in where
I am going on my own personal affair. And I
know Nan wouldn&#8217;t enjoy the prospect of an all-around
fight on her account. Fighting is a horror
to that girl. I&#8217;ve got her feelings to think about
as well as my own. I&#8217;ve decided what to do,
John. I&#8217;m going in alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going in alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night. Now, I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;d like
you to do if you want to: ride with me and wait
till morning, outside El Capitan. If you don&#8217;t
hear from me by ten o&#8217;clock, ride back to Calabasas
and notify Jeffries to look for a new manager.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, if we don&#8217;t hear from you
by ten o&#8217;clock, Henry, we will blaze our way in
and drag out your body.&#8221; Lefever put up his
hand to cut off any rejoinder. &#8220;Don&#8217;t discuss it.
What happens after ten o&#8217;clock to-morrow morning,
if we don&#8217;t hear from you before that, can&#8217;t
possibly be of any interest to you or make any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
difference.&#8221; He paused, but de Spain saw that
he was not done. When he resumed, he spoke
in a tone different from that which de Spain usually
associated with him. &#8220;Henry, when I was a
youngster and going to Sunday-school, my old
Aunt Lou often told me a story about a pitcher
that used to go to the well. And she told me it
went many, many times, safe and sound; but my
Aunt Lou told me, further, the pitcher got so used
to going to the well safe and sound that it finally
went once too many times, just once too often,
and got smashed all to hell. Aunt Lou didn&#8217;t
say it exactly in that way&ndash;&ndash;but such was the
substance of the moral.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve pulled a good many tough games in
this country, Henry. No man knows better than
I that you never pulled one for the looks of the
thing or to make people talk&ndash;&ndash;or that you ever
took a chance you didn&#8217;t feel you had to take.
But, it isn&#8217;t humanly possible you can keep this
up for all time; it <i>can&#8217;t</i> go on forever. The
pitcher goes to the well once too often, Henry;
there comes a time when it doesn&#8217;t come back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understand&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m not saying this to attempt
to dissuade you from the worst job you ever
started in on. I know your mind is made up.
You won&#8217;t listen to me; you won&#8217;t listen to Scott;
and I&#8217;m too good an Indian not to know where I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
get off, or not to do what I&#8217;m told. But this is
what I have been thinking of a long, long time;
and this is what I feel I ought to say, here and
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men were sitting in de Spain&#8217;s room.
De Spain was staring through the broad south
window at the white-capped peaks of the distant
range. He was silent for a time. &#8220;I believe
you&#8217;re right, John,&#8221; he said after a while. &#8220;I
know you are. In this case I am tied up more
than I&#8217;ve ever been tied before; but I&#8217;ve got to
see it through as best I can, and take what comes
without whining. My mind is made up and,
strange as it may sound to you, I feel that I <i>am</i>
coming back. Not but what I know it&#8217;s due me,
John. Not but what I expect to get it sometime.
And maybe I&#8217;m wrong now; but I don&#8217;t feel as
if it&#8217;s coming till I&#8217;ve given all the protection to
that girl that a man can give to a woman.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>A SURPRISING SLIP</h3>
</div>
<p>Scott was called by Lefever to conclude in
secret the final arrangements. The ground
about the quaking asp grove, and nearest El
Capitan, afforded the best concealment close to
the Gap. And to this point Scott was directed
to bring what men he could before daybreak the
following morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a short notice to get many men together&ndash;&ndash;of
the kind we want,&#8221; admitted Lefever.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to skirmish some between now and
midnight. What do you think you can do?&#8221;</p>
<p>Scott had already made up a tentative list.
He named four: first, Farrell Kennedy, who was
in town, and said nobody should go if he didn&#8217;t;
Frank Elpaso, the Texan; the Englishman, Tommie
Meggeson; and Wickwire, if he could be
located&ndash;&ndash;any one of them, Lefever knew, could
give an account of himself under all circumstances.</p>
<p>While Scott was getting his men together, de
Spain, accompanied by Lefever, was riding toward
Music Mountain. Scott had urged on them but
one parting caution&ndash;&ndash;not to leave the aspens until
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
rain began falling. When he spoke there was not
a cloud in the sky. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to rain to-night,
just the same,&#8221; predicted Scott. &#8220;Don&#8217;t leave
the trees till it gets going. Those Gap scouts will
get under cover and be hunting for a drink the
minute it gets cold&ndash;&ndash;I know them. You can ride
right over their toes, if you&#8217;ll be patient.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun set across the range in a drift of grayish-black,
low-lying clouds, which seemed only to
await its disappearance to envelop the mountains
and empty their moisture on the desert.
By the time de Spain and Lefever reached the
end of their long ride a misty rain was drifting
down from the west. The two men had just
ridden into the quaking asps when a man coming
out of the Gap almost rode into them. The intruders
had halted and were sufficiently hidden to
escape notice, had not Lefever&#8217;s horse indiscreetly
coughed. The man from the Gap reined up and
called out. Lefever answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Bull Page,&#8221; declared de Spain, after the
exchange of a few words, calling to Bull at the
same time to come over to the shelter of the trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on in there, Bull?&#8221; asked de
Spain after Bull had told him that Gale had
driven him out, and he was heading for Calabasas.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell,&#8221; retorted Page. &#8220;Looks to me like
old Duke&#8217;s getting ready to die. Gale says he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
going to draw his will to-night, and don&#8217;t want
nobody around&ndash;&ndash;got old Judge Druel in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain pricked up his ears. &#8220;What&#8217;s that,
Druel?&#8221; he demanded. Bull repeated his declaration.
Lefever broke into violent language at
the Sleepy Cat jurist&#8217;s expense, and ended by declaring
that no will should be drawn in the Gap
that night by Duke Morgan or anybody else, unless
he and Bull were made legatees.</p>
<p>Beyond this nothing could be learned from Bull,
who was persuaded without difficulty by Lefever
to abandon the idea of riding to Calabasas through
the rain, and to spend the night with him in the
neighborhood, wherever fancy, the rain, and the
wind&ndash;&ndash;which was rising&ndash;&ndash;should dictate.</p>
<p>While the two were talking de Spain tried to
slip away, unobserved by Lefever, on his errand.
He failed, as he expected to, and after some familiar
abuse, rode off alone, fortified by every
possible suggestion at the hands of a man to
whom the slightest precaution was usually a joke.</p>
<p>Mountains never look blacker than when one
rides into them conscious of the presence of enemies
and alert for signs and sounds. But custom
dulls the edge of apprehension. De Spain
rode slowly up the main road without expecting
to meet any one, and he reached the rise
where the trail forked to Duke&#8217;s ranch unchallenged.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
Here he stopped his horse and looked
down toward the roof that sheltered Nan. Night
had fallen everywhere, and the increasing rain
obscured even the outline of the house. But a
light shone through one uncurtained window.
He waited some time for a sound of life, for a
door to open or close, or for the dog to bark&ndash;&ndash;he
heard nothing. Slipping out of the wet saddle,
he led his horse in the darkness under the
shelter of the lone pine-tree and, securing him,
walked slowly toward the house.</p>
<p>The light came from a window in the living-room.
Up-stairs and toward the kitchen everything
was dark. De Spain walked gingerly
around to where he could command the living-room
window. He could see within, the figures
of three men but, owing to the dim light and the
distance at which he stood, he could identify none
of them with certainty. Mindful of the admonitions
he had been loaded with, he tramped around
the house in narrowing circles, pausing at times
to look and listen. In like manner he circled
the barn and stables, until he had made sure
there was no ambush and that he was alone
outside. He then went among the horses and,
working with a flash-light, found Nan&#8217;s pony, a
bridle and, after an ineffectual search for a saddle,
led the bareback horse out to where his own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
stood. Walking over to Nan&#8217;s window he signalled
and called to her. Getting no answer, he
tossed a bit of gravel up against her window.
His signal met with no response and, caching his
rifle under the kitchen porch, he stepped around
to the front of the house, where, screened by a
bit of shrubbery, he could peer at close range
into the living-room.</p>
<p>Standing before the fire burning in the open
hearth, and with his back to it, he now saw Gale
Morgan. Sitting bolt upright beside the table,
square-jawed and obdurate, his stubby brier pipe
supported by his hand and gripped in his great
teeth, Duke Morgan looked uncompromisingly
past his belligerent nephew into the fire. A third
and elderly man, heavy, red-faced, and almost
toothless as he spoke, sat to the right of the table
in a rocking-chair, and looked at Duke; this was
the old lawyer and justice from Sleepy Cat, the
sheriff&#8217;s brother&ndash;&ndash;Judge Druel.</p>
<p>Nan was not to be seen. Gale, big and aggressive,
was doing most of the talking, and energetically,
as was his habit. Duke listened thoughtfully,
but seemingly with coldness. Druel looked
from Gale to Duke, and appeared occasionally to
put in a word to carry the argument along.</p>
<p>De Spain suspected nothing of what they were
talking about, but he was uneasy concerning Nan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
and was not to be balked, by any combination,
of his purpose of finding her. To secure information
concerning her was not possible, unless he
should enter the house, and this, with scant hesitation,
he decided to do.</p>
<p>He wore a snug-fitting leathern coat. He unbuttoned
this and threw it open as he stepped
noiselessly up to the door. Laying his hand on
the knob, he paused, then, finding the door unlocked,
he pushed it slowly open.</p>
<p>The wind, rushing in, upset his calculations and
blew open the door leading from the hall into the
living-room. A stream of light in turn shot
through the open door, across the hall. Instantly
de Spain stepped inside and directly behind the
front door&ndash;&ndash;which he now realized he dare not
close&ndash;&ndash;and stood expectant in the darkness. Gale
Morgan, with an impatient exclamation, strode
from the fireplace to close the front door.</p>
<p>As he walked into the hall and slammed the
front door shut, he could have touched with his
hand the man standing in the shadow behind it.
De Spain, not hoping to escape, stood with folded
arms, but under the elbow of his left arm was
hidden the long muzzle of his revolver. Holding
his breath, he waited. Gale&#8217;s mind was apparently
filled with other things. He did not suspect the
presence of an intruder, and he walked back into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
the living-room, partly closing the second door.
De Spain, following almost on his heels, stepped
past this door, past the hall stairs opposite it,
and through a curtained opening at the end of
the hall into the dining-room. Barely ten feet
from him, this room opened through an arch into
the living-room, and where he stood he could hear
all that was said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; demanded Duke gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody,&#8221; said Gale. &#8220;Go on, Druel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That door never opened itself,&#8221; persisted
Duke.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind blew it open,&#8221; said Gale impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell y&#8217; it didn&#8217;t,&#8221; responded Duke sternly;
&#8220;somebody came in there, or went out. Maybe
she&#8217;s slipped y&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go up-stairs and see,&#8221; bellowed Gale at his
uncle.</p>
<p>Duke walked slowly out into the hall and, with
some difficulty, owing to his injured back, up the
stairs. A curtain hung beside the arch where de
Spain stood, and this he now drew around him.
Gale walked into the hall again, searched it, and
waited at the foot of the stairs. De Spain could
hear Duke&#8217;s rough voice up-stairs, but could
neither distinguish his words nor hear any response
to them. Within a moment the elder man
tramped heavily down again, saying only, &#8220;She&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
there,&#8221; and, followed by Gale, returned to the
living-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now go on, Druel,&#8221; exclaimed Gale, sitting
down impatiently, &#8220;and talk quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Druel talked softly and through his nose: &#8220;I
was only going to say it would be a good idea to
have two witnesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nita,&#8221; suggested Gale.</p>
<p>Duke was profane. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t keep the
girl in the room if she had Nita to help her. And
I want it understood, Gale, between you and me,
fair and square, that Nan&#8217;s goin&#8217; to live right
here with me after this marriage till I&#8217;m satisfied
she&#8217;s willing to go to you&ndash;&ndash;otherwise it can&#8217;t take
place, now nor never.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain opened his ears. Gale felt the hard,
cold tone of his crusty relative, and answered with
like harshness: &#8220;What do you keep harping on
that for? You&#8217;ve got my word. All I want of
you is to keep yours&ndash;&ndash;understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, come,&#8221; interposed Druel. &#8220;There&#8217;s no
need of hard words. But we need two witnesses.
Who&#8217;s going to be the other witness?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before any one could answer de Spain stepped
out into the open archway before the three men.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll act as the second witness,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With a common roar the Morgans bounded to
their feet. They were not unused to sudden
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
onslaughts, nor was either of them a man to
shrink from a fight at short quarters, if it came to
that, but blank astonishment overwhelmed both.
De Spain, standing slightly sidewise, his coat
lapels flapped wide open, his arms akimbo, and
his hands on his hips, faced the three in an attitude
of readiness only. He had reckoned on the
instant of indecision which at times, when coupled
with apprehension, paralyzes the will of two men
acting together. Under the circumstances either
of the Morgans alone would have whipped a gun
on de Spain at sight. Together, and knowing that
to do so meant death to the one that took the
first shot from the archway, each waited for the
other; that fraction of a second unsettled their
purpose. Instead of bullets, each launched curses
at the intruder, and every second that passed led
away from a fight.</p>
<p>De Spain took their oaths, demands, and abuse
without batting an eye. &#8220;I&#8217;m here for the second
witness,&#8221; was all he repeated, covering both men
with short glances. Druel, his face muddily
white as the whiskey bloat deserted it, shrunk inside
his shabby clothes. He seemed, every time
de Spain darted a look at him, to grow visibly
smaller, until his loose bulk had shrivelled inside
an armchair hardly large enough normally to
contain it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></div>
<p>De Spain with each epithet hurled at him
took a dreaded forward step toward Gale, and
Druel, in the line of fire, brought his knees up
and his head down till he curled like a porcupine.
Gale, game as he undoubtedly was, cornered, felt
perhaps recollections of Calabasas and close quarters
with the brown eyes and the burning face.
What they might mean in this little room, which
de Spain was crossing step by step, was food for
thought. Nor did de Spain break his obstinate
silence until their burst of rage had blown.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve arranged your marriage,&#8221; he said at
length. &#8220;Now pull it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My cousin&#8217;s ready to marry me, and she&#8217;s
goin&#8217; to do it to-night,&#8221; cried Gale violently.</p>
<p>Duke, towering with rage, looked at de Spain
and pointed to the hall door. &#8220;You hear that!
Get out of my house!&#8221; he cried, launching a
vicious epithet with the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t your house,&#8221; retorted de Spain
angrily. &#8220;This house is Nan&#8217;s, not yours. When
she orders me out I&#8217;ll go. Bring her down,&#8221; he
thundered, raising his voice to shut off Duke, who
had redoubled his abuse. &#8220;Bring her into this
room,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see whether she
wants to get married. If she does, I&#8217;ll marry her.
If she doesn&#8217;t, and you&#8217;ve been putting this up
to force her into marrying, so help me God, you&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
be carried out of this room to-night, or I will.&#8221;
He whirled on her uncle with an accusing finger.
&#8220;You used to be a man, Duke. I&#8217;ve taken from
you here to-night what I would take from no man
on earth but for the sake of Nan Morgan. She
asked me never to touch you. But if you&#8217;ve gone
into this thing to trap your own flesh and blood,
your dead brother&#8217;s girl, living under your own
protection, you don&#8217;t deserve mercy, and to-night
you shall have what&#8217;s coming to you. I&#8217;ve fought
you both fair, too fair. Now&ndash;&ndash;before I leave&ndash;&ndash;it&#8217;s
my girl or both of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was standing near Druel. Without taking
his eyes off the other men, he caught Druel with
his left hand by the coat collar, and threw him
half-way across the room. &#8220;Get up-stairs, you
old carrion, and tell Nan Morgan, Henry de Spain
is here to talk to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Druel, frightened to death, scrambled into the
hall. He turned on de Spain. &#8220;I&#8217;m an officer
of the law. I arrest you for trespass and assault,&#8221;
he shouted, shaking with fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arrest <i>me</i>?&#8221; echoed de Spain contemptuously.
&#8220;You scoundrel, if you don&#8217;t climb those stairs
I&#8217;ll send you to the penitentiary the day I get
back to town. Up-stairs with your message!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessary,&#8221; said a low voice in the
hall, and with the words Nan appeared in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
open doorway. Her face was white, but there was
no sign of haste or panic in it; de Spain choked
back a breath; to him she never had looked in
her silence so awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>He addressed her, holding his left hand out
with his plea. &#8220;Nan,&#8221; he said, controlling his
voice, &#8220;these men were getting ready to marry
you to Gale Morgan. No matter how you feel
toward me now, you know me well enough to
know that all I want is the truth: Was this with
your consent?&#8221;</p>
<p>She stepped into the line of fire between her
cousin and de Spain as she answered. &#8220;No.
You know I shall never marry any man but you.
This vile bully,&#8221; she turned a little to look at her
angry cousin, &#8220;has influenced Uncle Duke&ndash;&ndash;who
never before tried to persecute or betray me&ndash;&ndash;into
joining him in this thing. They never could
have dragged me into it alive. And they&#8217;ve kept
me locked for three days in a room up-stairs,
hoping to break me down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>If de Spain&#8217;s words of warning struck her with
terror of a situation she could not control, she did
not reveal it. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said resolutely. &#8220;If
anybody here is to be shot, I&#8217;ll be first. Uncle
Duke, you have always protected me from Gale
Morgan; now you join hands with him. You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
drive me from this roof because I don&#8217;t know how
I can protect myself under it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gale looked steadily at her. &#8220;You promised
to marry me,&#8221; he muttered truculently. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
find a way to make you keep your word.&#8221;</p>
<p>A loud knocking interrupted him, and, without
waiting to be admitted, Pardaloe, the cowboy,
opened the front door and stalked boldly in from
the hall.</p>
<p>If the situation in the room surprised him he
gave no evidence of it. And as he walked in
Nan disappeared. Pardaloe was drenched with
rain, and, taking off his hat as he crossed the room
to the fire, he shook it hard into the blazing wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want, Pardaloe?&#8221; snapped Duke.</p>
<p>Pardaloe shook his hat once more and turned
a few steps so that he stood between the uncurtained
window and the light. &#8220;The creek&#8217;s up,&#8221;
he said to Duke in his peculiarly slow, steady
tone. &#8220;Some of Satt&#8217;s boys are trying to get
the cattle out of the lower corral.&#8221; He fingered
his hat, looked first at Duke, then at Gale, then
at de Spain. &#8220;Guess they&#8217;ll need a little help,
so I asked Sassoon to come over&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Pardaloe
jerked his head indicatively toward the front.
&#8220;He&#8217;s outside with some of the boys now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Sassoon to come in here!&#8221; thundered
Gale.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></div>
<p>De Spain&#8217;s left arm shot out. &#8220;Hold on, Pardaloe;
pull down that curtain behind you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch that curtain, Pardaloe!&#8221; shouted
Gale Morgan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardaloe,&#8221; said de Spain, his left arm pointing
menacingly and walking instantly toward him,
&#8220;pull that curtain or pull your gun, quick.&#8221; At
that moment Nan, in hat and coat, reappeared in
the archway behind de Spain. Pardaloe jerked
down the curtain and started for the door. De
Spain had backed up again. &#8220;Stop, Pardaloe,&#8221;
he called. &#8220;My men are outside that door.
Stand where you are,&#8221; he ordered, still enforcing
his commands with his right hand covering the
holster at his hip. &#8220;I leave this room first. Nan,
are you ready?&#8221; he asked, without looking at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her uncle&#8217;s face whitened. &#8220;Don&#8217;t leave this
house to-night, Nan,&#8221; he said menacingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve forced me to, Uncle Duke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave this house to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t protect myself in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t leave this house&ndash;&ndash;most of all, with that
man!&#8221; He pointed at de Spain with a frenzy of
hatred. Without answering, the two were retreating
into the semidarkness of the dining-room.
&#8220;Nan,&#8221; came her uncle&#8217;s voice, hoarse with feeling,
&#8220;you&#8217;re saying good-by to me forever.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No, uncle,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I am only doing
what I have to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I don&#8217;t want to drive you from this
roof, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>A rush of wind from an opening door was the
only answer from the dark dining-room. The
two Morgans started forward together. The sudden
gust sucked the flame of the living-room lamp
up into the chimney and after a brief, sharp
struggle extinguished it. In the confusion it was
a moment before a match could be found. When
the lamp was relighted the Morgans ran into the
dining-room. The wind and rain poured in
through the open north door. But the room was
empty.</p>
<p>Duke turned on his nephew with a choking
curse. &#8220;This,&#8221; he cried, beside himself with
fury, &#8220;is your work!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>FLIGHT</h3>
</div>
<p>It was a forbidding night. Moisture-laden
clouds, drifting over the Superstition Range,
emptied their fulness against the face of the
mountains in a downpour and buried the Gap in
impenetrable darkness. De Spain, catching Nan&#8217;s
arm, spoke hurriedly, and they hastened outside
toward the kitchen. &#8220;We must get away quick,&#8221;
he said as she buttoned her coat. And, knowing
how she suffered in what she was doing, he drew
her into the shelter of the porch and caught her
close to him. &#8220;It had to come, Nan. Don&#8217;t
shed a tear. I&#8217;ll take you straight to Mrs. Jeffries.
When you are ready, you&#8217;ll marry me; we&#8217;ll
make our peace with your Uncle Duke together.
Great God! What a night! This way, dearie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, to the stable, Henry! Where&#8217;s your
horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Under the pine, and yours, too. I found the
pony, but I couldn&#8217;t find your saddle, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know where it&#8217;s hidden. Let&#8217;s get the
horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute. I stuck my rifle under this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
porch.&#8221; He stooped and felt below the stringer.
Rising in a moment with the weapon on his arm,
the two hurried around the end of the house
toward the pine-tree. They had almost reached
this when a murmur unlike the sounds of the
storm made de Spain halt his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she whispered. He listened intently.
While they stood still the front door of
the house was opened hurriedly. A man ran out
along the porch toward the stable. Neither Nan
nor de Spain could make out who it was, but de
Spain heard again the suspicious sound that had
checked him. Without speaking, he took Nan
and retreated to the corner of the house. &#8220;There
is somebody in that pine,&#8221; he whispered, &#8220;waiting
for me to come after the horses. Sassoon may
have found them. I&#8217;ll try it out, anyway, before
I take a chance. Stand back here, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>He put her behind the corner of the house,
threw his rifle to his shoulder, and fired as nearly
as he could in the darkness toward and just
above the pine. Without an instant&#8217;s hesitation
a pistol-shot answered from the direction in which
he had fired, and in another moment a small fusillade
followed. &#8220;By the Almighty,&#8221; muttered
de Spain, &#8220;we must have our horses, Nan. Stay
right here. I&#8217;ll try driving those fellows off their
perch.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span></div>
<p>She caught his arm. &#8220;What are you going to
do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run in on them from cover, wherever I can
find it, Nan, and push them back. We&#8217;ve got to
have those horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry, we can get others from the stable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There may be more men waiting there for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could only get away without a fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Sassoon and his gang, Nan. You
heard Pardaloe. These are not your people.
I&#8217;ve got to drive &#8217;em, or we&#8217;re gone, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; Her tone was unmistakable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan, you can&#8217;t do it,&#8221; whispered de Spain
energetically. &#8220;A chance bullet&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke with decision: &#8220;I go with you. I
can use a rifle. Better both of us be killed than
one. Help me up on this roof. I&#8217;ve climbed it a
hundred times. My rifle is in my room. Quick,
Henry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overruling his continued objections, she lifted
her foot to his hand, caught hold of the corner-post,
and springing upward got her hands on the
low end of the roof boards. With the agility of
a cat, she put her second foot on de Spain&#8217;s shoulder,
gained the sloping roof, and scrambled on her
hands and knees up toward the window of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
room. The heavy rain and the slippery boards
made progress uncertain, but with scarcely any
delay, she reached her window and pushed open
the casement sash. A far-off peal of thunder
echoed down from the mountains. Luckily, no
flash had preceded it, and Nan, rifle in hand, slid
safely down to the end of the lean-to, where de
Spain, waiting, caught one foot on his shoulder,
and helped her to the ground. He tried again
to make her stay behind the house. Finding his
efforts vain, he directed her how to make a zigzag
advance, how to utilize for cover every rock and
tree she could find in the line toward the pine,
and, above all, to throw herself flat and sidewise
after every shot&ndash;&ndash;and not to fire often.</p>
<p>In this way, amid the falling of rain and the uncharted
dangers of the darkness, they advanced
on the pine-tree. Surprisingly little effort seemed
necessary to drive off whoever held it. De Spain
made his way slowly but safely to the disputed
point and then understood&ndash;&ndash;the horses were gone.</p>
<p>He had hardly rejoined Nan, who waited at a
safe distance, and told her the bad news, when a
fresh discharge of shots came from two directions&ndash;&ndash;seemingly
from the house and the stable. A
moment later they heard sharp firing far down the
Gap. This was their sole avenue of escape. It
was bad enough, under the circumstances, to negotiate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
the trail on horseback&ndash;&ndash;but to expose Nan,
who had but just put herself under his protection,
to death from a chance bullet while stumbling
along on foot, surrounded by enemies&ndash;&ndash;who could
follow the flash of their own shots if they were
forced to use their rifles, and close in on them at
will&ndash;&ndash;was an undertaking not to be faced.</p>
<p>They withdrew to the shelter of a large rock
familiar to Nan even in the dark. While de Spain
was debating in his mind how to meet the emergency,
she stood at his side, his equal, he knew, in
courage, daring, and resource, and answered his
rapid questions as to possible gateways of escape.
The rain, which had been abating, now ceased,
but from every fissure in the mountains came the
roar of rushing water, and little openings of rock
and waterway that might have offered a chance
when dry were now out of the question. In fact,
it was Nan&#8217;s belief that before morning water
would be running over the main trail itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet,&#8221; said de Spain finally, &#8220;before morning
we must be a long way from this particular spot,
Nan. Lefever is down there&ndash;&ndash;I haven&#8217;t the
slightest doubt of that. Sassoon has posted men
at the neck of the Gap&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s the first thing he
would do. And if John heard my rifle when I
first shot, he would be for breaking in here, and
his men, if they&#8217;ve come up, would bump into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
Sassoon&#8217;s. It would be insane for us to try to
get out over the trail with Sassoon holding it
against Lefever&ndash;&ndash;we might easily be hit by our
friends instead of our enemies. I&#8217;ll tell you what,
Nan, suppose I scout down that way alone and
see what I can find out?&#8221;</p>
<p>He put the proposal very lightly, realizing almost
as soon as he made it what her answer would
be. &#8220;Better we go together,&#8221; she answered in
the steady tone he loved to hear. &#8220;If you were
killed, what would become of me? I should
rather be shot than fall into his hands after this&ndash;&ndash;if
there was ever a chance for it before, there&#8217;d
be no mercy now. Let&#8217;s go together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He would not consent, and she knew he was
right. But what was right for one was right, she
told him, for both, and what was wrong for one
was wrong for both. &#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; he
said suddenly, as when after long uncertainty and
anxious doubt one chooses an alternative and
hastens to follow it. &#8220;Retreat is the thing for
us, Nan. Let&#8217;s make for Music Mountain and
crawl into our cave till morning. Lefever will get
in here some time to-morrow. Then we can connect
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>They discussed the move a little further, but
there seemed no escape from the necessity of it,
despite the hardship involved in reaching the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
refuge; and, realizing that no time was to be lost,
they set out on the long journey. Every foot of
the troublesome way offered difficulties. Water
impeded them continually. It lay in shallow
pools underfoot and slipped in running sheets
over the sloping rocks that lay in their obscure
path. Sometimes de Spain led, sometimes Nan
picked their trail. But for her perfect familiarity
with every foot of the ground they could not have
got to the mountain at all.</p>
<p>Even before they succeeded in reaching the
foot of it their ears warned them of a more serious
obstacle ahead. When they got to the mountain
trail itself they heard the roar of the stream
that made the waterfall above the ledge they
were trying to reach. Climbing hardly a dozen
steps, they found their way swept by a mad rush
of falling water, its deafening roar punctured by
fragments of loosened rock which, swept downward
from ledge to ledge, split and thundered as
they dashed themselves against the mountainside.
On a protected floor the two stood for a
moment, listening to the roar of the cataract that
had cut them off their refuge.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use, Nan,&#8221; said de Spain. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t
any other trail, is there?&#8221;</p>
<p>She told him there was no other. &#8220;And this
will run all night,&#8221; she added. &#8220;Sometimes it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
runs like this for days. I ought to have known
there would be a flood here. But it all depends
on which side of the mountain the heavy rain
falls. Henry,&#8221; she said, turning to him and as
if thinking of a question she wanted to ask,
&#8220;how did you happen to come to me just to-night
when I wanted you so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came because you sent for me,&#8221; he answered,
surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t send for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, dumfounded. &#8220;What do you
mean, Nan?&#8221; he demanded uneasily. &#8220;I got
your message on the telephone to come at once
and take you away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry! I didn&#8217;t send any message&ndash;&ndash;when
did you get one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night, in my office in Sleepy Cat, from
a man that refused to give his name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never sent any message to you,&#8221; she insisted
in growing wonderment. &#8220;I have been locked in
a room for three days, dearie. The Lord knows
I wanted to send you word. Who ever telephoned
a message like that? Was it a trap to get you in
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>He told her the story&ndash;&ndash;of the strenuous efforts
he had made to discover the identity of the messenger&ndash;&ndash;and
how he had been balked. &#8220;No matter,&#8221;
said Nan, at last. &#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
a trap. It must have been a friend, surely, not
an enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or,&#8221; said de Spain, bending over her as if he
were afraid she might escape, and putting his
face close to hers, &#8220;some mildly curious person,
some idle devil, Nan, that wanted to see what
two timid men would look like, mixed up in a
real fight over the one girl in the mountains both
are trying to marry at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry,&#8221; every time she repeated his name de
Spain cared less for what should happen in the
rest of the world, &#8220;what are we going to do now?
We can&#8217;t stay here all night&ndash;&ndash;and take what they
will greet us with in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He answered her question with another: &#8220;What
about trying to get out by El Capitan?&#8221;</p>
<p>She started in spite of herself. &#8220;I mean,&#8221; he
added, &#8220;just to have a look over there, Nan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you even have a look a night like
this?&#8221; she asked, overcome at the thought of
the dizzy cliff. &#8220;It would be certain death,
Henry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean at the worst to try to cross it
till we get a glimpse of daylight. But it&#8217;s quite
a way over there. I remember some good hiding-places
along that trail. We may find one
where I can build a little fire and dry you out.
I&#8217;m more worried over you being wet all night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
than the rest of it. The question is, Can we find
a trail up to where we want to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know two or three,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;if they
are only not flooded.&#8221;</p>
<p>The storm seemed to have passed, but the darkness
was intense, and from above the northern
Superstitions came low mutterings of thunder.
Compelled to strike out over the rocks to get up
to any of the trails toward El Capitan, Nan,
helped by de Spain when he could help, led the
ascent toward the first ledge they could hope to
follow on their dangerous course.</p>
<p>The point at which the two climbed almost
five hundred feet that night up Music Mountain
is still pointed out in the Gap. An upturned
rock at the foot, a stunted cedar jutting from the
ledge at the point they finally gained, marked the
beginning and end of their effort. No person,
looking at that confused wall, willingly believes it
could ever have been scaled in the dead of night.
Torn, bruised, and exhausted, Nan, handed up
by her lover, threw herself at last prostrate on
the ledge at the real beginning of their trail, and
from that vantage-point they made their way
along the eastern side of Music Mountain for two
miles before they stopped again to rest.</p>
<p>It was already well after midnight. A favoring
spot was seized on by de Spain for the resting-place
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
he wanted. A dry recess beneath an overhanging
wall made a shelter for the fire that he
insisted on building to warm Nan in her soaked
clothing. He found cedar roots in the dark and
soon had a blaze going. It was dangerous, both
realized, to start a fire, but they concealed the
blaze as best they could and took the chance&ndash;&ndash;a
chance that more nearly than any that had gone
before, cost them their lives. But what still lay
ahead of the two justified in de Spain&#8217;s mind what
he was doing. He acted deliberately in risking
the exposure of their position to unfriendly eyes
far distant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>EL CAPITAN</h3>
</div>
<p>The mutterings above the mountains now
grew rapidly louder and while the two hovered
over the fire, a thunder-squall, rolling wildly
down the eastern slope, burst over the Gap. Its
sudden fury put aside for a time all question of
moving, and Nan&#8217;s face took on a grave expression
as she looked in the firelight at her companion,
thinking of how far such a storm might
imperil their situation, how far cut off their already
narrow chance of escape.</p>
<p>De Spain&ndash;&ndash;reclining close beside her, looking
into the depths of her eyes as the flickering blaze
revealed them, drying himself in their warmth
and light, eating and drinking of their presence
on the mountainside alone with him, and pledged
to him, his protection, and his fortunes against
the world&ndash;&ndash;apparently thought of nothing beyond
the satisfaction of the moment. The wind
drove the storm against the west side of the huge
granite peak under which they were sheltered and
gave them no present trouble in their slender
recess. But Nan knew even better than her companion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
the fickle fury of a range storm, and understood
uncomfortably well how a sudden shift
might, at any moment, lay their entire path open
to its fierceness. She warned de Spain they must
be moving, and, freshened by the brief rest, they
set out toward El Capitan.</p>
<p>Their trail lay along granite levels of comparatively
good going and, fleeing from the squall,
they had covered more than half the distance
that separated them from the cliff, when a second
thunder-storm, seeming to rush in from the desert,
burst above their heads. Drenched with rain,
they were forced to draw back under a projecting
rock. In another moment the two storms,
meeting in the Gap, crashed together. Bolt upon
bolt of lightning split the falling sheets of water,
and thunder, exploding in their faces, stunned
and deafened them.</p>
<p>Mountain peaks, played on by the wild light,
leaped like spectres out of the black, and granite
crags, searched by blazing shafts, printed themselves
in ghostly flames on the retina; thunder,
searching unnumbered gorges, echoed beneath the
sharper crashes in one long, unending roll, and
far out beyond the mountains the flooded desert
tossed on a dancing screen into the glare, rippled
like a madcap sea, and flashed in countless sheets
of blinding facets. As if an unseen hand had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
touched a thousand granite springs above the
Gap, every slender crevice spouted a stream that
shot foaming out from the mountainsides. The
sound of moving waters rose in a dull, vast roar,
broken by the unseen boom of distant falls,
launching huge masses of water into caverns far
below. The storm-laden wind tore and swirled
among the crowded peaks, and above all the
angry sky moaned and quivered in the rage of
the elements.</p>
<p>Nan leaned within de Spain&#8217;s arm. &#8220;If this
keeps up,&#8221; he said after some time, &#8220;our best
play is to give up crossing to-night. We might
hide somewhere on the mountain to-morrow, and
try it toward evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if we have to,&#8221; she answered. But he
perceived her reluctant assent. &#8220;What I am
afraid of, Henry, is, if they were to find us. You
know what I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we won&#8217;t hide,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The minute
we get the chance we will run for it. This is
too fierce to last long.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but it&#8217;s November!&#8221; Nan reminded him
apprehensively. &#8220;It&#8217;s winter; that&#8217;s what makes
it so cold. You never can tell in November.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t last all night, anyway,&#8221; he answered
with confidence.</p>
<p>Despite his assurance, however, it did last all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
night, and it was only the lulls between the sharp
squalls that enabled them to cover the trail before
daylight. When they paused before El Capitan
the fury of the night seemed largely to have
exhausted itself, but the overcharged air hung
above the mountains, trembling and moaning like
a bruised and stricken thing. Lightning, playing
across the inky heavens, blazed in constant sheets
from end to end of the horizon. Its quivering
glare turned the wild night into a kind of ghastly,
uncertain day. Thunder, hoarse with invective,
and hurled mercilessly back and forth by the fitful
wind, drew farther and farther into the recess of
the mountains, only to launch its anger against
its own imprisoned echoes. Under it all the two
refugees, high on the mountainside, looked down
on the flooding Gap.</p>
<p>Their flight was almost ended. Only the sheer
cliff ahead blocked their descent to the aspen
grove. De Spain himself had already crossed El
Capitan once, and he had done it at night&ndash;&ndash;but
it was not, he was compelled to remind himself,
on a night like this. It seemed now a madman&#8217;s
venture and, without letting himself appear to do
so, he watched Nan&#8217;s face as the lightning played
over it, to read if he could, unsuspected, whether
she still had courage for the undertaking. She
regarded him so collectedly, whether answering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
a question or asking one, that he marvelled at her
strength and purpose. Hardly a moment passed
after they had started until the eastern sky lightened
before the retreating storm, and with the
first glimmer of daylight, the two were at the
beginning of the narrow foothold which lay for
half a mile between them and safety.</p>
<p>Here the El Capitan trail follows the face of
the almost vertical wall which, rising two thousand
feet in the air, fronts the gateway of Morgan&#8217;s
Gap.</p>
<p>They started forward, de Spain ahead. There
was nothing now to hurry them unduly, and everything
to invite caution. The footholds were slippery,
rivulets still crossed the uncertain path,
and fragments of rock that had washed down on
the trail, made almost every step a new hazard.
The face of El Capitan presents, midway, a sharp
convex. Just where it is thrown forward in this
keen angle, the trail runs out almost to a knife-edge,
and the mountain is so nearly vertical that
it appears to overhang the floor of the valley.</p>
<p>They made half the stretch of this angle with
hardly a misstep, but the advance for a part of
the way was a climb, and de Spain, turning once
to speak to Nan, asked her for her rifle, that he
might carry it with his own. What their story
might have been had she given it to him, none
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
can tell. But Nan, holding back, refused to let
him relieve her. The dreaded angle which had
haunted de Spain all night was safely turned on
hands and knees and, as they rounded it toward
the east, clouds scudding over the open desert
broke and shot the light of dawn against the
beetling ar&ecirc;te.</p>
<p>De Spain turned in some relief to point to the
coming day. As he did so a gust of wind, sweeping
against the sheer wall, caught him off his
guard. He regained his balance, but a stone,
slipping underfoot, tipped him sidewise, and he
threw himself on his knees to avoid the dizzy
edge. As he fell forward he threw up his hand
to save his hat, and in doing so released his rifle,
which lay under his hand on the rock. Before
he could recover it the rifle slipped from reach.
In the next instant he heard it bouncing from
rock to rock, five hundred feet below.</p>
<p>Greatly annoyed and humiliated, he regained
his feet and spoke with a laugh to reassure Nan.
Just as she answered not to worry, a little singing
scream struck their ears; something splashed suddenly
close at hand against the rock wall; chips
scattered between them. From below, the sound
of a rifle report cracked against the face of the
cliff. They were so startled, so completely amazed
that they stood motionless. De Spain looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span>
down and over the uneven floor of the Gap. The
ranch-houses, spread like toys in the long perspective,
lay peacefully revealed in the gray of
the morning. Among the dark pine-trees he
could discern Nan&#8217;s own home. Striving with
the utmost keenness of vision to detect where
the shot had come from, de Spain could discover
no sign of life around any of the houses. But in
another moment the little singing scream came
again, the blow of the heavy slug against the
splintering rock was repeated, the distant report
of the rifle followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Under fire,&#8221; muttered de Spain. He looked
questioningly at Nan. She herself, gazing across
the dizzy depths, was searching for the danger-point.
A third shot followed at a seemingly
regular interval&ndash;&ndash;the deliberate interval needed
by a painstaking marksman working out his
range and taking his time to find it. De Spain
watched Nan&#8217;s search anxiously. &#8220;We&#8217;d better
keep moving,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come! whoever is
shooting can follow us a hundred yards either
way.&#8221; In front of de Spain a fourth bullet struck
the rock. &#8220;Nan,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got you
into a fix. If we can&#8217;t stop that fellow he is
liable to stop us. Can you see anything?&#8221; he
asked, waiting for her to come up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry!&#8221; She was looking straight down into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
the valley, and laid her hand on de Spain&#8217;s shoulder.
&#8220;Is there anything moving on the ridge&ndash;&ndash;over
there&ndash;&ndash;see&ndash;&ndash;just east of Sassoon&#8217;s ranch-house?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain, his eyes bent on the point Nan indicated,
drew her forward to a dip in the trail which,
to one stretched flat, afforded a slight protection.
He made her lie down, and just beyond her refuge
chose a point where the path, broadening a little
and rising instead of sloping toward the outer
edge, gave him a chance to brace himself between
two rocks. Flattened there like a target in mid-air,
he threw his hat down to Nan and, resting on
one knee, waited for the shot that should tumble
him down El Capitan or betray the man bent on
killing him. Squalls of wind, sweeping into the
Gap and sucked upward on the huge expanse
of rock below, tossed his hair and ballooned his
coat as he buttoned it. Another bullet, deliberately
aimed, chipped the rock above him. Nan,
agonizing in her suspense, cried out she must join
him and go with him if he went. He steadied
her apprehension and with a few words reminded
her, as a riflewoman, what a gamble every shot
at a height such as they occupied, and with such
a wind, must be. He reminded her, too, it was
much easier to shoot down than up, but all the
time he was searching for the flash that should
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
point the assassin. A bullet struck again viciously
close between them. De Spain spoke slowly:
&#8220;Give me your rifle.&#8221; Without turning his head
he held out his hand, keeping his eyes rigidly on
the suspicious spot on the ridge. &#8220;How far is it
to that road, Nan?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked toward the faint line that lay in the
deep shadows below. &#8220;Three hundred yards.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nan, if it wasn&#8217;t for you, I couldn&#8217;t travel
this country at all,&#8221; he remarked with studious
unconcern. &#8220;Last time I had no ammunition&ndash;&ndash;this
time, no rifle&ndash;&ndash;you always have what&#8217;s needed.
How high are we, Nan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven hundred feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Elevate for me, Nan, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember the wind,&#8221; she faltered, adjusting
the sight as he had asked.</p>
<p>With the cautioning words she passed the burnished
weapon, glittering yet with the rain-drops,
into his hand. A flash came from the distant
ridge. Throwing the rifle to his shoulder, de
Spain covered a hardly perceptible black object
on the trail midway between Sassoon&#8217;s ranch-house
and a little bridge which he well remembered&ndash;&ndash;he
had crossed it the night he dragged Sassoon
into town. It seemed a long time that he pressed
the rifle back against his shoulder and held his
eye along the barrel. He was wondering as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
covered the crouching man with the deadly sight
which of his enemies this might be. He even
slipped the rifle from his shoulder and looked long
and silently at the black speck before he drew the
weapon back again into place. Then he fired before
Nan could believe he had lined the sights.
Once, twice, three times his hand fell and rose
sharply on the lever, with every mark of precision,
yet so rapidly Nan could not understand
how he could discover what his shots were doing.</p>
<p>The fire came steadily back, and deliberately,
without the least intimation of being affected by
de Spain&#8217;s return. It was a duel shorn of every
element of equality, with an assassin at one end
of the range, and a man flattened half-way up the
clouds against El Capitan at the other, each determined
to kill the other before he should stir
one more foot.</p>
<p>Far above, an eagle, in morning flight, soared
majestically out from a jutting crag and circled
again and again in front of El Capitan, while the
air sang with the whining dice that two gamblers
against death threw across the gulf between them.
Nan, half hidden in her trough of rock, watched
the great bird poise and wheel above the deadly
firing, and tried to close her eyes to the figure of
de Spain above her, fighting for her life and his
own.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span></div>
<p>She had never before seen a man shooting to
kill another. The very horror of watching de Spain,
at bay among the rocks, fascinated her.
Since the first day they had met she had hardly
seen a rifle in his hands.</p>
<p>Realizing how slightly she had given thought
to him or to his skill at that time, she saw now,
spellbound, how a challenge to death, benumbing
her with fear, had transformed him into a silent,
pitiless foeman, fighting with a lightning-like decision
that charged every motion with a fatality
for his treacherous enemy. Her rifle, at his shoulder,
no longer a mere mechanism, seemed in his
hands something weightless, sensible, alive, a
deadly part of his arm and eye and brain. There
was no question, no thought of adjusting or handling
or haste in his fire, but only an incredible
swiftness and sureness that sent across the thin-aired
chasm a stream of deadly messengers to
seek a human life. She could only hope and pray,
without even forming the words, that none of
her blood were behind the other rifle, for she felt
that, whoever was, could never escape.</p>
<p>She tried not to look. The butt of the heating
rifle lay close against the red-marked cheek she
knew so well, and to the tips of the fingers every
particle of the man&#8217;s being was alive with strength
and resource. Some strange fascination drew her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span>
senses out toward him as he knelt and threw shot
after shot at the distant figure hidden on the
ridge. She wanted to climb closer, to throw herself
between him and the bullets meant for him.
She held out her arms and clasped her hands
toward him in an act of devotion. Then while
she looked, breathlessly, he took his eyes an instant
from the sights. &#8220;He&#8217;s running!&#8221; exclaimed
de Spain as the rifle butt went instantly
back to his cheek. &#8220;Whoever he is, God help
him now!&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were more fearful to Nan than an
imprecation. He had driven his enemy from the
scant cover of a rut in the trail, and the man was
fleeing for new cover and for life. The speck of
black in the field of intense vision was moving
rapidly toward the ranch-house. Bullet after
bullet pitilessly led the escaping wretch. Death
dogged every eager footfall. Suddenly de Spain
jerked the rifle from his cheek, threw back his
head, and swept his left hand across his straining
eyes. Once more the rifle came up to place and,
waiting for a heartbeat, to press the trigger, he
paused an instant. Flame shot again in the gray
morning light from the hot muzzle. The rifle fell
away from the shoulder. The black speck running
toward the ranch-house stumbled, as if
stricken by an axe, and sprawled headlong on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
trail. Throwing the lever again like lightning,
de Spain held the rifle back to his cheek.</p>
<p>He did not fire. Second after second he waited,
Nan, lying very still, watching, mute, the dull-red
mark above the wet rifle butt. No one had
need to tell her what had happened. Too well
she read the story in de Spain&#8217;s face and in what
she saw, as he knelt, perfectly still, only waiting
to be sure there was no ruse. She watched the
rifle come slowly down, unfired, and saw his drawn
face slowly relax. Without taking his eyes off
the sprawling speck, he rose stiffly to his feet.
As if in a dream she saw his hand stretched toward
her and heard, as he looked across the far gulf,
one word: &#8220;Come!&#8221;</p>
<p>They reached the end of the trail. De Spain,
rifle in hand, looked back. The sun, bursting in
splendor across the great desert, splashed the valley
and the low-lying ridge with ribboned gold.
Farther up the Gap, horsemen, stirred by the
firing, were riding rapidly down toward Sassoon&#8217;s
ranch-house. But the black thing in the sunshine
lay quite still.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>LEFEVER TO THE RESCUE</h3>
</div>
<p>Lefever, chafing in the aspen grove under
the restraint of waiting in the storm, was
ready long before daylight to break orders and
ride in to find de Spain.</p>
<p>With the first peep of dawn, and with his men
facing him in their saddles, Lefever made a short
explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want any man to go into the Gap
with me this morning under any misunderstanding
or any false pretense,&#8221; he began cheerfully.
&#8220;Bob Scott and Bull will stay right here. If, by
any chance, de Spain makes his way out while the
rest of us are hunting for him, you&#8217;ll be here to
signal us&ndash;&ndash;three shots, Bob&ndash;&ndash;or to ride in with
de Spain to help carry the rest of us out. Now,
it&#8217;s like this,&#8221; he added, addressing the others.
&#8220;You, all of you know, or ought to know&ndash;&ndash;everybody
&#8217;twixt here and the railroad knows&ndash;&ndash;that de
Spain and Nan Morgan have fastened up to each
other for the long ride down the dusty trail together.
That, I take it, is their business. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span>
her uncle, old Duke, and Gale, and the whole
bunch, I hear, turned dead sore on it, and have
fixed it up to beat them. You all know the Morgans.
They&#8217;re some bunch&ndash;&ndash;and they stick for
one another like hornets, and all hold together in
a fight. So I don&#8217;t want any man to ride in there
with me thinking he&#8217;s going to a wedding. He
isn&#8217;t. He may or may not be going to a funeral,
but he&#8217;s <i>not</i> going to a shivaree.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank Elpaso glanced sourly at his companions.
&#8220;I guess everybody here is wise, John.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know <i>you</i> are, Frank,&#8221; retorted Lefever
testily; &#8220;that&#8217;s all right. I&#8217;m only explaining.
And I don&#8217;t want <i>you</i> to get sore on me if I <i>don&#8217;t</i>
show you a fight.&#8221; Frank Elpaso grunted. &#8220;I
am under orders.&#8221; John waved his hand. &#8220;And
I can&#8217;t do anything&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But talk,&#8221; growled Frank Elpaso, not waving
his hand.</p>
<p>Lefever started hotly forward in his saddle.
&#8220;Now look here, Frank.&#8221; He pointed his finger
at the objecting ranger. &#8220;I&#8217;m here for business,
not for pleasure. Any time I&#8217;m free you can talk
to me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not till somebody gags you, John,&#8221; interposed
Elpaso moodily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Elpaso,&#8221; demanded Lefever, spurring
his horse smartly toward the Texan, &#8220;are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
you looking for a fight with me right here and
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, here and now,&#8221; declared Elpaso fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or, there and then,&#8221; interposed Kennedy,
ironically, &#8220;some time, somewhere, or no time,
nowhere. Having heard all of which, a hundred
and fifty times from you two fellows, let us have
peace. You&#8217;ve pulled it so often, over at Sleepy
Cat, they&#8217;ve got it in double-faced, red-seal
records. Let&#8217;s get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are, Farrell,&#8221; assented Lefever,
&#8220;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Second verse, John. You&#8217;re boss here; what
are we going to do? That&#8217;s all we want to know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry&#8217;s orders were to wait here till ten
o&#8217;clock this morning. There&#8217;s been firing inside
twice since twelve o&#8217;clock last night. He told me
to pay no attention to that. But if the whole
place hadn&#8217;t been under water all night, I&#8217;d have
gone in, anyway. This last time it was two high-powered
guns, picking at long range and, if I&#8217;m
any judge of rifles and the men probably behind
them, some one must have got hurt. It&#8217;s all a
guess&ndash;&ndash;but I&#8217;m going in there, peaceably if I can,
to look for Henry de Spain; if we are fired on&ndash;&ndash;we&#8217;ve
got to fight for it. And if there&#8217;s any
talking to be done&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can do it,&#8221; grunted Elpaso.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Frank. And I will do it. I need
not say that Kennedy will ride ahead with me,
Elpaso and Wickwire with Tommie Meggeson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving Scott in the trees, the little party
trotted smartly up the road, picking their way
through the pools and across the brawling streams
that tore over the trail toward Duke Morgan&#8217;s
place. The condition of the trail broke their
formation continually and Lefever, in the circumstances,
was not sorry. His only anxiety
was to keep Elpaso from riding ahead far enough
to embroil them in a quarrel before he himself
should come up.</p>
<p>Half-way to Duke&#8217;s house they found a small
bridge had gone out. It cut off the direct road,
and, at Elpaso&#8217;s suggestion, they crossed over to
follow the ridge up the valley. Swimming their
horses through the backwater that covered the
depression to the south, they gained the elevation
and proceeded, unmolested, on their way.
As they approached Sassoon&#8217;s place, Elpaso, riding
ahead, drew up his horse and sat a moment studying
the trail and casting an occasional glance in
the direction of the ranch-house, which lay under
the brow of a hill ahead.</p>
<p>When Lefever rode up to him, he saw the story
that Elpaso was reading in the roadway. It told
of a man shot in his tracks as he was running
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
toward the house&ndash;&ndash;and, in the judgment of
these men, fatally shot&ndash;&ndash;for, while his companions
spread like a fan in front of him, Lefever got off his
horse and, bending intently over the sudden page
torn out of a man&#8217;s life, recast the scene that had
taken place, where he stood, half an hour earlier.
Some little time Lefever spent patiently deciphering
the story printed in the rutted road, and
marked by a wide crimson splash in the middle of
it. He rose from his study at length and followed
back the trail of the running feet that had
been stricken at the pool. He stopped in front
of a fragment of rock jutting up beside the road,
studied it a while and, looking about, picked up
a number of empty cartridge-shells, examined
them, and tossed them away. Then he straightened
up and looked searchingly across the Gap.
Only the great, silent face of El Capitan confronted
him. It told no tales.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this was Henry de Spain,&#8221; muttered Elpaso,
when Lefever rejoined his companions, &#8220;he won&#8217;t
care whether you join him now, or at ten o&#8217;clock,
or never.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is not Henry,&#8221; asserted Lefever with
his usual cheer. &#8220;Not within forty rows of apple-trees.
It&#8217;s not Henry&#8217;s gun, not Henry&#8217;s heels,
not Henry&#8217;s hair, and thereby, not Henry&#8217;s head
that was hit that time. But it was to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
finish&ndash;&ndash;and blamed if at first it didn&#8217;t scare me. I
thought it <i>might</i> be Henry. Hang it, get down
and see for yourselves, boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elpaso answered his invitation with an inquiry.
&#8220;Who was this fellow fighting with?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That, also, is a question. Certainly not with
Henry de Spain, because the other fellow, I think,
was using soft-nosed bullets. No white man does
that, much less de Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he used another rifle,&#8221; suggested Kennedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me how they could get his own rifle away
from him if he could fire a gun at all. I don&#8217;t
put Henry quite as high with a rifle as with a
revolver&ndash;&ndash;if you want to split hairs&ndash;&ndash;mind, I say,
if you want to split hairs. But no man that&#8217;s
ever seen him handle either would want to try
to take any kind of a gun from him. Whoever it
was,&#8221; Lefever got up into his saddle again, &#8220;threw
some ounces of lead into that piece of rock back
there, though I don&#8217;t understand how any one
could see a man lying behind it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, whoever was hit here has been carried
down the road. We&#8217;ll try Sassoon&#8217;s ranch-house
for news, if they don&#8217;t open on us with
rifles before we get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the sunshine a man in shirt sleeves, and leaning
against the jamb, stood in the open doorway
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
of Sassoon&#8217;s shack, watching the invaders as they
rode around the hill and gingerly approached.
Lefever recognized Satt Morgan. He flung a
greeting to him from the saddle.</p>
<p>Satt answered in kind, but he eyed the horsemen
with reserve when they drew up, and he
seemed to Lefever altogether less responsive than
usual. John sparred with him for information,
and Satterlee gave back words without any.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell us anything about de Spain, eh?&#8221;
echoed Lefever at length. &#8220;All right, Satt, we&#8217;ll
find somebody that can. Is there a bridge over
to Duke&#8217;s on this trail?&#8221;</p>
<p>Satt&#8217;s nose wrinkled into his normal smile.
&#8220;There is a bridge&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; The report of three shots
fired in the distance, seemingly from the mouth
of the Gap, interrupted him. He paused in his
utterance. There were no further shots, and he
resumed: &#8220;There is a bridge that way, yes, but
it was washed out last night. They&#8217;re blockaded.
Duke and Gale are over there. They&#8217;re pretty
sore on your man de Spain. You&#8217;d better keep
away from &#8217;em this morning unless you&#8217;re looking
for trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefever, having all needed information from
Scott&#8217;s signal, raised his hand quickly. &#8220;Not at
all,&#8221; he exclaimed, leaning forward to emphasize
his words and adding the full orbit of his eye to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span>
his sincerity of manner. &#8220;Not at all, Satt. This
is all friendly, all friendly. But,&#8221; he coughed
slightly, as if in apology, &#8220;if Henry shouldn&#8217;t
turn up all right, we&#8217;ll&ndash;&ndash;ahem&ndash;&ndash;be back.&#8221;</p>
<p>None of his companions needed to be told how
to get prudently away. At a nod from Lefever
Tommie Meggeson, Elpaso, and Wickwire wheeled
their horses, rode rapidly back to the turn near
the hill and, facing about, halted, with their rifles
across their arms. Lefever and Kennedy followed
leisurely, and the party withdrew leaving
Satterlee, unmoved, in the sunny doorway.
Once out of sight, Lefever led the way rapidly
down the Gap to the rendezvous.</p>
<p>Of all the confused impressions that crowded
Nan&#8217;s memory after the wild night on Music
Mountain, the most vivid was that of a noticeably
light-stepping and not ungraceful fat man
advancing, hat in hand, to greet her as she stood
with de Spain, weary and bedraggled in the aspen
grove.</p>
<p>A smile flamed from her eyes when, turning at
once, he rebuked de Spain with dignity for not
introducing him to Nan, and while de Spain made
apologies Lefever introduced himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;And is this,&#8221; murmured Nan, looking at him
quizzically, &#8220;really Mr. John Lefever whom I&#8217;ve
heard so many stories about?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span></div>
<p>She was conscious of his pleasing eyes and even
teeth as he smiled again. &#8220;If they have come
from Mr. de Spain&ndash;&ndash;I warn you,&#8221; said John,
&#8220;take them with all reserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they haven&#8217;t all come from Mr. de Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they come from any of my friends, discredit
them in advance. You could believe what my
enemies say,&#8221; he ran on; then added ingenuously,
&#8220;if I had any enemies!&#8221; To de Spain he talked
very little. It seemed to take but few words to
exchange the news. Lefever asked gingerly about
the fight. He made no mention whatever of the
crimson pool in the road near Sassoon&#8217;s hut.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>PUPPETS OF FATE</h3>
</div>
<p>The house in the Gap that had sheltered Nan
for many years seemed never so empty as
the night she left it with de Spain. In spite of
his vacillation, her uncle was deeply attached to
her. She made his home for him. He had never
quite understood it before, but the realization
came only too soon after he had lost her. And
his resentment against Gale as the cause of her
leaving deepened with every hour that he sat
next day with his stubborn pipe before the fire.
Duke had acceded with much reluctance to the
undertaking that was to force her into a marriage.
Gale had only partly convinced him that once
taken, the step would save her from de Spain and
end their domestic troubles. The failure of the
scheme left Duke sullen, and his nephew sore, with
humiliation.</p>
<p>In spite of the alarms and excitement of the
night, of Gale&#8217;s determination that de Spain
should never leave the Gap with Nan, and of the
rousing of every man within it to cut off their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
escape, Duke stubbornly refused to pursue the
man he so hated or even to leave the house in
any effort to balk his escape. But Gale, and Sassoon
who had even keener reason for hating de
Spain, left Duke to sulk as he would, and set
about getting the enemy without any help from
the head of the house. In spite of the caution
with which de Spain had covered his movements,
and the flood and darkness of the night, Sassoon
by a mere chance had got wind through one of
his men of de Spain&#8217;s appearance at Duke
Morgan&#8217;s, and had begun to plan, before Nan and
de Spain had got out of the house, how to trap
him.</p>
<p>Duke heard from Pardaloe, during the night and
the early morning, every report with indifference.
He only sat and smoked, hour after hour, in silence.
But after it became known that de Spain
had, beyond doubt, made good his escape, and
had Nan with him, the old man&#8217;s sullenness
turned into rage, and when Gale, rankling with
defeat, stormed in to see him in the morning, he
caught the full force of Duke&#8217;s wrath. The
younger man taken aback by the outbreak and
in drink himself, returned his abuse without hesitation
or restraint. Pardaloe came between them
before harm was done, but the two men parted
with the anger of their quarrel deepened.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span></div>
<p>When Nan rode with de Spain into Sleepy Cat
that morning, Lefever had already told their
story to Jeffries over the telephone from Calabasas,
and Mrs. Jeffries had thrown open her
house to receive Nan. Weary from exposure,
confusion, and hunger, Nan was only too grateful
for a refuge.</p>
<p>On the evening of the second day de Spain was
invited to join the family at supper. In the evening
the Jeffrieses went down-town.</p>
<p>De Spain was talking with Nan in the living-room
when the telephone-bell rang in the library.</p>
<p>De Spain took the call, and a man&#8217;s voice answered
his salutation. The speaker asked for
Mr. de Spain and seemed particular to make sure
of his identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; repeated de Spain more than once, and
somewhat testily, &#8220;is Henry de Spain speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have a little talk with you, Mr. de
Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean over the telephone. Could you
make it convenient to come down-town somewhere,
say to Tenison&#8217;s, any time this evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought of a possible ambuscade deterred
the listener less than the thought of leaving Nan,
from whom he was unwilling to separate himself
for a moment. Likewise, the possibility of an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span>
attempt to kidnap her in his absence was not
overlooked. On the other hand, if the message
came from Duke and bore some suggestion of a
compromise in the situation, de Spain was unwilling
to lose it. With these considerations turning
in his mind, he answered the man brusquely:
&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The vein of sharpness in the question met with
no deviation from the slow, even tone of the voice
at the other end of the wire. &#8220;I am not in position
to give you my name,&#8221; came the answer,
&#8220;at least, not over the wire.&#8221;</p>
<p>A vague impression suddenly crossed de Spain&#8217;s
mind that somewhere he had heard the voice
before. &#8220;I can&#8217;t come down-town to-night,&#8221; returned
de Spain abruptly. &#8220;If you&#8217;ll come to
my office to-morrow morning at nine, I&#8217;ll talk
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pause preceded the answer. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t
hardly do for me to come to your office in daylight.
But if it would, I couldn&#8217;t do it to-morrow,
because I shan&#8217;t be in town in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you talking from now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at Tenison&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hang you,&#8221; said de Spain instantly, &#8220;I know
you now.&#8221; But he said the words to himself,
not aloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose I could come up to where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
you are to-night for a few minutes&#8217; talk?&#8221; continued
the man coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless you have something very important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I have is more important to you than
to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain took an instant to decide. &#8220;All
right,&#8221; he said impatiently; &#8220;come along. Only&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;
he paused to let the word sink in, &#8220;&ndash;&ndash;if this is a
game you&#8217;re springing&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m springing no game,&#8221; returned the man
evenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re liable to be one of the men hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fair enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Jeffries&#8217;s place is west of the court-house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Directly west. Now, I&#8217;ll tell you just how to
get here. Do you hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave Main Street at Rancherio Street. Follow
Rancherio north four blocks, turn west into
Grant Avenue. Mr. Jeffries&#8217;s house is on the
corner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come any other way. If you do, you
won&#8217;t see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of you, Mr. de Spain, and I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span>
come as you say. There&#8217;s only one thing I should
like to ask. It would be as much as my life is
worth to be seen talking to you. And there are
other good reasons why I shouldn&#8217;t like to have
it known I <i>had</i> talked to you. Would you mind
putting out the lights before I come up&ndash;&ndash;I mean,
in the front of the house and in the room where
we talk?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in the least. I mean&ndash;&ndash;I am always willing
to take a chance against any other man&#8217;s.
But I warn you, come prepared to take care of
yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will do as I ask, no harm will come to
any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain heard the receiver hung up at the
other end of the wire. He signalled the operator
hastily, called for his office, asked for Lefever, and,
failing to get him, got hold of Bob Scott. To
him he explained rapidly what had occurred, and
what he wanted. &#8220;Get up to Grant and Rancherio,
Bob, as quick as the Lord will let you.
Come by the back streets. There&#8217;s a high mulberry
hedge at the southwest corner you can get
behind. This chap may have been talking for
somebody else. Anyway, look the man over when
he passes under the arc-light. If it is Sassoon or
Gale Morgan, come into Jeffries&#8217;s house by the
rear door. Wait in the kitchen for my call from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span>
the living-room, or a shot. I&#8217;ll arrange for your
getting in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leaving the telephone, de Spain rejoined Nan
in the living-room. He told her briefly of the expected
visit and explained, laughingly, that his
caller had asked to have the lights out and to
see him alone.</p>
<p>Nan, standing close to him, her own hand on
his shoulder and her curling hair against his
scarred cheek, asked questions about the incident
because he seemed to be holding something back.
She professed to be satisfied when he requested her
to go up to her room and explained it was probably
one of the men coming to tell about some petty
thieving on the line or of a strike brewing among
the drivers. He made so little of the incident
that Nan walked up the stairs on de Spain&#8217;s arm
reassured. When he kissed her at her room door
and turned down the stairs again, she leaned in
the half-light over the banister, waving one hand
at him and murmuring the last caution: &#8220;Be
careful, Henry, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearie, I&#8217;m always careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause you&#8217;re all I&#8217;ve got now,&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all I&#8217;ve got, Nan, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got any home&ndash;&ndash;or anything&ndash;&ndash;just
you. Don&#8217;t go to the door yourself. Leave the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
front door open. Stand behind the end of the
piano till you are awfully sure who it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What a head, Nan!&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain cut off the lights, threw open the front
door, and in the darkness sat down on the piano
stool. A heavy step on the porch, a little while
later, was followed by a knock on the open door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; called de Spain roughly. The bulk
of a large man filled and obscured for an instant
the opening, then the visitor stepped carefully
over the threshold. &#8220;What do you want?&#8221;
asked de Spain without changing his tone. He
awaited with keenness the sound of the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Henry de Spain here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice was not familiar to de Spain&#8217;s ear.
He told himself the man was unknown to him.
&#8220;I am Henry de Spain,&#8221; he returned without
hesitation. &#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>The visitor&#8217;s deliberation was reflected in his
measured speaking. &#8220;I am from Thief River,&#8221;
he began, and his reverberating voice was low
and distinct. &#8220;I left there some time ago to do
some work in Morgan&#8217;s Gap. I guess you know,
full as well as I do, that the general office at Medicine
Bend has its own investigators, aside from
the division men. I was sent in to Morgan&#8217;s
Gap some time ago to find out who burned the
Calabasas barn.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Railroad man, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For about six years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you report to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kennedy.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain paused in spite of his resolve to push
the questions. While he listened a fresh conviction
had flashed across his mind. &#8220;You called
me up on the telephone one night last week,&#8221; he
said suddenly.</p>
<p>The answer came without evasion. &#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I chased you across the river?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You gave me a message from Nan Morgan
that she never gave you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. I thought she needed you right off.
She didn&#8217;t know me as I rightly am. I knew
what was going on. I rode into town that evening
and rode out again. It was not my business,
and I couldn&#8217;t let it interfere with the business
I&#8217;m paid to look after. That&#8217;s the reason I
dodged you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a chair at the left of the door; sit
down. What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man feeling around slowly, deposited his angular
bulk with care upon the little chair. &#8220;My
name&#8221;&ndash;&ndash;in the tenseness of the dark the words
seemed to carry added mystery&ndash;&ndash;&#8220;is Pardaloe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where from?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span></div>
<p>&#8220;My home is southwest of the Superstition
Mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a brother&ndash;&ndash;Joe Pardaloe?&#8221; suggested
de Spain to trap him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve got no brother. I am just plain Jim
Pardaloe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say what you have got to say, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The only job I could get in the Gap was with
old Duke Morgan&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;ve been working for him,
off and on, and spending the rest of my time with
Gale and Dave Sassoon. There were three men
in the barn-burning. Dave Sassoon put up the
job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Dave Sassoon now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean what I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both men were silent for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday morning&#8217;s fight?&#8221; asked de Spain
reluctantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did he happen to catch us on El Capitan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He saw a fire on Music Mountain and watched
the lower end of the Gap all night. Sassoon was
a wide-awake man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sorry, Pardaloe,&#8221; continued de
Spain after a moment. &#8220;Nobody could call it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
my fault. It was either he or I&ndash;&ndash;or the life of a
woman who never harmed a hair of his head,
and a woman I&#8217;m bound to protect. He was
running when he was hit. If he had got to cover
again there was nothing to stop him from picking
both of us off. I shot low&ndash;&ndash;most of the lead
must have gone into the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was hit in the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a soft-nose bullet,&#8221; continued Pardaloe.</p>
<p>Again there was a pause. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you about
that, too, Pardaloe,&#8221; de Spain went on collectedly.
&#8220;I lost my rifle before that man opened fire on
us. Nan happened to have her rifle with her&ndash;&ndash;if
she hadn&#8217;t, he&#8217;d &#8217;ve dropped one or both of us
off El Capitan. We were pinned against the wall
like a couple of targets. If there were soft-nose
bullets in her rifle it&#8217;s because she uses them
on game&ndash;&ndash;bobcats and mountain-lions. I never
thought of it till this minute. That is it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What I came up to tell you has to do with
Dave Sassoon. From what happened to-day in
the Gap I thought you ought to know it now.
Gale and Duke quarrelled yesterday over the way
things turned out; they were pretty bitter. This
afternoon Gale took it up again with his uncle,
and it ended in Duke&#8217;s driving him clean out of
the Gap.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Where has he gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody knows yet. Ed Wickwire told me
once that your father was shot from ambush a
good many years ago. It was north of Medicine
Bend, on a ranch near the Peace River; that you
never found out who killed him, and that one
reason why you came up into this country was
to keep an eye out for a clew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about it?&#8221; asked de Spain, his tone
hardening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was riding home one night about a month
ago from Calabasas with Sassoon. He&#8217;d been
drinking. I let him do the talking. He began
cussing you out, and talked pretty hard about
what you&#8217;d done, and what he&#8217;d done, and what
he was going to do&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; Nothing, it seemed, would
hurry the story. &#8220;Finally, Sassoon says: &#8216;That
hound don&#8217;t know yet who got his dad. It was
Duke Morgan; that&#8217;s who got him. I was with
Duke when he turned the trick. We rode down
to de Spain&#8217;s ranch one night to look up a rustler.&#8217;
That,&#8221; concluded Pardaloe, &#8220;was all Sassoon
would say.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped. He seemed to wait. There was
no word of answer, none of comment from the
man sitting near him. But, for one, at least, who
heard the passionless, monotonous recital of a
murder of the long ago, there followed a silence as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span>
relentless as fate, a silence shrouded in the mystery
of the darkness and striking despair into two
hearts&ndash;&ndash;a silence more fearful than any word.</p>
<p>Pardaloe shuffled his feet. He coughed, but
he evoked no response. &#8220;I thought you was entitled
to know,&#8221; he said finally, &#8220;now that Sassoon
will never talk any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain moistened his lips. When he spoke
his voice was cracked and harsh, as if with what
he had heard he had suddenly grown old.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Pardaloe. I thank you. I&ndash;&ndash;when
I&ndash;&ndash;in the morning. Pardaloe, for the present,
go back to the Gap. I will talk with Wickwire&ndash;&ndash;to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Mr. de Spain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Pardaloe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bending forward, limp, in his chair, supporting
his head vacantly on his hands, trying to think
and fearing to think, de Spain heard Pardaloe&#8217;s
measured tread on the descending steps, and
listened mechanically to the retreating echoes of
his footsteps down the shaded street. Minute
after minute passed. De Spain made no move.
A step so light that it could only have been the
step of a delicate girlhood, a step free as the footfall
of youth, poised as the tread of womanhood
and beauty, came down the stairs. Slight as she
was, and silent as he was, she walked straight to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
him in the darkness, and, sinking between his feet,
wound her hands through his two arms. &#8220;I
heard everything, Henry,&#8221; she murmured, looking
up. An involuntary start of protest was his
only response. &#8220;I was afraid of a plot against
you. I stayed at the head of the stairs. Henry,
I told you long ago some dreadful thing would
come between us&ndash;&ndash;something not our fault. And
now it comes to dash our cup of happiness when
it is filling. Something told me, Henry, it would
come to-night&ndash;&ndash;some bad news, some horror laid
up against us out of a past that neither you nor
I are to blame for. In all my sorrow I am sorriest,
Henry, for you. Why did I ever cross your path
to make you unhappy when blood lay between
your people and mine? My wretched uncle! I
never dreamed he had murder on his soul&ndash;&ndash;and of
all others, that murder! I knew he did wrong&ndash;&ndash;I
knew some of his associates were criminals.
But he has been a father and mother to
me since I could creep&ndash;&ndash;I never knew any father
or mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped, hoping perhaps he would say
some little word, that he would even pat her
head, or press her hand, but he sat like one
stunned. &#8220;If it could have been anything but
this!&#8221; she pleaded, low and sorrowfully. &#8220;Oh,
why did you not listen to me before we were engulfed!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
My dear Henry! You who&#8217;ve given me
all the happiness I have ever had&ndash;&ndash;that the blood
of my own should come against you and yours!&#8221;
The emotion she struggled with, and fought back
with all the strength of her nature, rose in a resistless
tide that swept her on, in the face of his
ominous silence, to despair. She clasped her hands
in silent misery, losing hope with every moment
of his stoniness that she could move him to restraint
or pity toward her wretched foster-father.
She recalled the merciless words he had spoken
on the mountain when he told her of his father&#8217;s
death. Her tortured imagination pictured the
horror of the sequel, in which the son of the murdered
man should meet him who had taken his
father&#8217;s life. The fate of it, the hopelessness of
escape from its awful consequence, overcame her.
Her breath, no longer controlled, came brokenly,
and her voice trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been very kind to me, Henry&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ve
been the only man I&#8217;ve ever known that
always, everywhere, thought of me first. I told
you I didn&#8217;t deserve it, I wasn&#8217;t worthy of it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His hands slipped silently over her hands. He
gathered her close into his arms, and his tears fell
on her upturned face.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>HOPE FORLORN</h3>
</div>
<p>There were hours in that night that each
had reason long to remember; a night that
seemed to bring them, in spite of their devotion,
to the end of their dream. They parted late,
each trying to soften the blow as it fell on the
other, each professing a courage which, in the
face of the revelation, neither could clearly feel.</p>
<p>In the morning Jeffries brought down to de
Spain, who had spent a sleepless night at the
office, a letter from Nan.</p>
<p>De Spain opened it with acute misgivings.
Hardly able to believe his eyes, he slowly read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class='smcap'>Dearest</span>:</p>
<p>A wild hope has come to me. Perhaps we don&#8217;t know
the truth of this terrible story as it really is. Suppose we
should be condemning poor Uncle Duke without having the
real facts? Sassoon was a wretch, Henry, if ever one lived&ndash;&ndash;a
curse to every one. What purpose he could serve by
repeating this story, which he must have kept very secret
till now, I don&#8217;t know; but there was some reason. I <i>must</i>
know the whole truth&ndash;&ndash;I feel that I, alone, can get hold of
it, and that you would approve what I am doing if you were
here with me in this little room, where I am writing at daybreak,
to show you my heart.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span></div>
<p>Long before you get this I shall be speeding toward the
Gap. I am going to Uncle Duke to get from him the exact
truth. Uncle Duke is breaking&ndash;&ndash;has broken&ndash;&ndash;and now that
the very worst has come, and we must face it, he will tell
me what I ask. Whether I can get him to repeat this to
you, to come to you, to throw himself on your pity, my dearest
one, I don&#8217;t know. But it is for this I am going to try,
and for this I beg of your love&ndash;&ndash;the love of which I have been
so proud!&ndash;&ndash;that you will let me stay with him until I at least
learn everything and can bring the whole story to you.
If I can bring him, I will.</p>
<p>And I shall be safe with him&ndash;&ndash;perfectly safe. Gale has
been driven away. Pardaloe, I know I can trust, and he
will be under the roof with me. <i>Please, do not try to come
to me.</i> It might ruin everything. Only forgive me, and I
shall be back with what I hope for, or what I fear, very, very
soon. Not till then can I bear to look into your eyes. You
have a better right than anyone in the world to know the
whole truth, cost what it may. Be patient for only a little
while with</p>
<p class='ralign'><span class='smcap'>Nan.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was Jeffries who said, afterward, he hoped
never again to be the bearer of a letter such as
that. Never until he had read and grasped the
contents of Nan&#8217;s note had Jeffries seen the
bundle of resource and nerve and sinew, that men
called Henry de Spain, go to pieces. For once,
trouble overbore him.</p>
<p>When he was able to speak he told Jeffries
everything. &#8220;It is my fault,&#8221; he said hopelessly.
&#8220;I was so crippled, so stunned, she must have
thought&ndash;&ndash;I see it now&ndash;&ndash;that I was making ready
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
to ride out by daybreak and shoot Duke down on
sight. It&#8217;s the price a man must pay, Jeffries,
for the ability to defend himself against this
bunch of hold-up men and assassins. Because
they can&#8217;t get me, I&#8217;m a &#8216;gunman&#8217;&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re not a &#8216;gunman.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A gunman and nothing else. That&#8217;s what
everybody, friends and enemies, reckon me&ndash;&ndash;a
gunman. You put me here to clean out this
Calabasas gang, not because of my good looks,
but because I&#8217;ve been, so far, a fraction of a
second quicker on a trigger than these double-damned
crooks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get any fun out of standing for ten
minutes at a time with a sixty-pound safety-valve
dragging on my heart, watching a man&#8217;s eye to
see whether he is going to pull a gun on me and
knock me down with a slug before I can pull one
and knock him down. I don&#8217;t care for that kind
of thing, Jeff. Hell&#8217;s delight! I&#8217;d rather have
a little ranch with a little patch of alfalfa&ndash;&ndash;enough
alfalfa to feed a little bunch of cattle, a hundred
miles from every living soul. What I would like to
do is to own a piece of land under a ten-cent ditch,
and watch the wheat sprout out of the desert.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeffries, from behind his pipe, regarded de
Spain&#8217;s random talk calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do feel hard over my father&#8217;s death,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
went on moodily. &#8220;Who wouldn&#8217;t? If God
meant me to forget it, why did he put this mark
on my face, Jeff? I did talk pretty strong to
Nan about it on Music Mountain. She accused
me then of being a gunman. It made me hot to
be set down for a gunman by her. I guess I did
give it back to her too strong. That&#8217;s the trouble&ndash;&ndash;my
bark is worse than my bite&ndash;&ndash;I&#8217;m always
putting things too strong. I didn&#8217;t know when
I was talking to her then that Sandusky and
Logan were dead. Of course, she thought I was
a butcher. But how could I help it?</p>
<p>&#8220;I did feel, for a long time, I&#8217;d like to kill with
my own hands the man that murdered my father,
Jeff. My mother must have realized that her
babe, if a man-child, was doomed to a life of bloodshed.
I&#8217;ve been trying to think most of the night
what she&#8217;d want me to do now. I don&#8217;t know
what I <i>can</i> do, or can&#8217;t do, when I set eyes on
that old scoundrel. He&#8217;s got to tell the truth&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
all I say now. If he lies, after what he
made my mother suffer, he ought to die like a
dog&ndash;&ndash;no matter who he is.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to break Nan&#8217;s heart. What
can I do? Hanging him here in Sleepy Cat, if
I could do it, wouldn&#8217;t help her feelings a whole
lot. If I could see the fellow&ndash;&ndash;&#8221; de Spain&#8217;s
hands, spread before him on the table, drew up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
tight, &#8220;if I could get my fingers on his throat, for
a minute, and talk to him, tell him what I think
of him&ndash;&ndash;I might know what I would want to do&ndash;&ndash;Nan
might be there to see and judge between
us. I&#8217;d be almost willing to leave things to her
to settle herself. I only want what&#8217;s right.
But,&#8221; the oath that recorded his closing threat
was collected and pitiless, &#8220;if any harm comes to
that girl now from this wild trip back among
those wolves&ndash;&ndash;God pity the men that put it over.
I&#8217;ll wipe out the whole accursed clan, if I have to
swing for it right here in Sleepy Cat!&#8221;</p>
<p>John Lefever, Jeffries, Scott in turn took him
in hand to hold him during three days, to restrain
the fury of his resentment, and keep him from
riding to the Gap in a temper that each of them
knew would mean only a tragedy worse than
what had gone before. Mountain-men who happened
in and out of Sleepy Cat during those three
days remember how it seemed for that time as
if the attention of every man and woman in the
whole country was fixed on the new situation that
balked de Spain. They knew only that Nan had
gone back to her people, not why she had gone
back; but the air was eager with surmise and
rumor as to what had happened, and in this complete
overturning of all de Spain&#8217;s hopes, what
would happen before the story ended.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span></div>
<p>Even three days of tactful representation and
patient admonition from cool-headed counsellors
did not accomplish all they hoped for in de Spain&#8217;s
attitude. His rage subsided, but only to be followed
by a settled gloom that they knew might
burst into uncontrollable anger at any moment.</p>
<p>A report reached McAlpin that Gale Morgan
was making ready to return to Music Mountain
with the remnant of Sandusky&#8217;s gang, to make
a demand on Duke for certain property and
partnership adjustments. This rumor he telephoned
to Jeffries. Before talking with de Spain,
Jeffries went over the information with Lefever.
The two agreed it was right, in the circumstances,
that de Spain should be nearer than Sleepy Cat
to Nan. Moreover, the period of waiting she had
enjoined on him was almost complete.</p>
<p>Without giving de Spain the story fully, the
two men talking before him let the discussion drift
toward a proposal on his part to go down to Calabasas,
where he could more easily keep track of
any movement to or from the Gap, and this they
approved. De Spain, already chafing under a
hardly endured restraint, lost no time in starting
for Calabasas, directing Lefever to follow next
day.</p>
<p>It added nothing to his peace of mind in the
morning to learn definitely from McAlpin that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
Gale Morgan, within twenty-four hours, had really
disappeared from Calabasas. No word of any
kind had come from Music Mountain for days.
No one at Calabasas was aware even that Nan
had gone into the Gap again. Bob Scott was at
Thief River. De Spain telephoned to him to
come up on the early stage, and turned his attention
toward getting information from Music
Mountain without violating Nan&#8217;s injunction not
to frustrate her most delicate effort with her
uncle.</p>
<p>As a possible scout to look into her present
situation and report on it, McAlpin could point
only to Bull Page. Bull was a ready instrument,
but his present value as an assistant had become
a matter of doubt, since practically every man in
the Gap had threatened within the week to blow
his head off&ndash;&ndash;though Bull himself felt no scruples
against making an attempt to reach Music Mountain
and get back again. It was proposed by the
canny McAlpin to send him in with a team and
light wagon, ostensibly to bring out his trunk,
which, if it had not been fed to the horses, was
still in Duke&#8217;s barn. As soon as a rig could be
got up Page started out.</p>
<p>It was late November. A far, clear air drew
the snow-capped ranges sharply down to the eye
of the desert&ndash;&ndash;as if the speckless sky, lighted by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
the radiant sun, were but a monster glass rigged
to trick the credulous retina. De Spain, in the
saddle in front of the barn, his broad hat brim
set on the impassive level of the Western horseman,
his lips seeming to compress his thoughts,
his lines over his forearm, and his hands half-slipped
into the pockets of his snug leather coat,
watched Page with his light wagon and horses
drive away.</p>
<p>Idling around the neighborhood of the barns
in the saddle, de Spain saw him gradually recede
into the long desert perspective, the perspective
which almost alone enabled the watcher to realize
as he curtained his eyes behind their long, steady
lashes from the blazing sun, that it was a good
bit of a way to the foot of the great outpost of
the Superstition Range.</p>
<p>De Spain&#8217;s restlessness prevented his remaining
quietly anywhere for long. As the morning advanced
he cantered out on the Music Mountain
trail, thinking of and wishing for a sight of Nan.
The deadly shock of Pardaloe&#8217;s story had been
dulled by days and nights of pain. His deep-rooted
love and his loneliness had quieted his impulse
for vengeance and overborne him with a
profound sadness. He realized how different his
feelings were now from what they had been when
she knelt before him in the darkened room and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_393' name='page_393'></a>393</span>
not daring to plead for mercy for her uncle, had
asked him only for the pity for herself that he had
seemed so slow to give. Something reproached
him now for his coldness at the moment that
he should have thought of her suffering before
his own.</p>
<p>The crystal brightness of the day brought no
elation to his thoughts. His attention fixed on
nothing that did not revert to Nan and his hunger
to see her again. If he regarded the majestic
mountain before him, it was only to recall the
day she had fed him at its foot, long before she
loved him&ndash;&ndash;he thought of that truth now&ndash;&ndash;when
he lay dying on it. If the black reaches of the
lava beds came within view, it was only to remind
him that, among those desolate rocks, this
simple, blue-eyed girl, frail in his eyes as a cobweb
despite her graceful strength, had intrusted
all her life and happiness to him, given her fresh
lips to his, endured without complaint the headstrong
ardor of his caresses and, by the pretty
mockery of her averted eyes, provoked his love to
new adventure.</p>
<p>Memory seemed that morning as keen as the
fickle air&ndash;&ndash;so sharply did it bring back to him
the overwhelming pictures of their happiness together.
And out of his acute loneliness rose
vague questionings and misgivings. He said to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span>
himself in bitter self-reproach that she would not
have gone if he had been to her all he ought to
have been in the crisis of that night. If harm
should befall her now! How the thought clutched
and dragged at his heart. Forebodings tortured
him, and in the penumbra of his thoughts seemed
to leave something he could not shake off&ndash;&ndash;a
vague, haunting fear, as if of some impending
tragedy that should wreck their future.</p>
<p>It was while riding in this way that his eyes,
reading mechanically the wagon trail he was
aimlessly following&ndash;&ndash;for no reason other than that
it brought him, though forbidden, a little closer
to her&ndash;&ndash;arrested his attention. He checked his
horse. Something, the trail told him, had happened.
Page had stopped his horses. Page had
met two men on horseback coming from the Gap.
After a parley&ndash;&ndash;for the horses had tramped around
long enough for one&ndash;&ndash;the wagon had turned completely
from the trail and struck out across the
desert, north; the two horsemen, or one with a
led horse, had started back for the Gap.</p>
<p>All of this de Spain gathered without moving
his horse outside a circle of thirty feet. What
did it mean? Page might have fallen in with
cronies from the Gap, abandoned his job, and
started for Sleepy Cat, but this was unlikely.
He might have encountered enemies, been pointedly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
advised to keep away from the Gap, and pretended
to start for Sleepy Cat, to avoid trouble
with them. Deeming the second the more probable
conclusion, de Spain, absorbed in his speculations,
continued toward the Gap to see whether
he could not pick up the trail of Page&#8217;s rig farther
on.</p>
<p>Within a mile a further surprise awaited him.
The two horsemen, who had headed for the Gap
after stopping Page, had left the trail, turned
to the south, down a small draw, which would
screen them from sight, and set out across the
desert.</p>
<p>No trail and no habitation lay in the direction
they had taken&ndash;&ndash;and it seemed clearer to de Spain
that the second horse was a led horse. There was
a story in the incident, but his interest lay in
following Page&#8217;s movements, and he spurred
swiftly forward to see whether his messenger had
resumed the Gap trail and gone on with his mission.
He followed this quest almost to the mountains,
without recovering any trace of Page&#8217;s rig.
He halted. It was certain now that Page had
not gone into the Gap.</p>
<p>Perplexed and annoyed, de Spain, from the
high ground on which he sat his horse, cast his
eyes far out over the desert. The brilliant sunshine
flooded it as far as the eye could reach. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span>
scanned the vast space without detecting a sign
of life anywhere, though none better than he knew
that any abundance of it might be there. But
his gaze caught something of interest on the farthest
northern horizon, and on this his scrutiny
rested a long time. A soft brown curtain rose
just above the earth line against the blue sky.
Toward the east it died away and toward the
west it was cut off by the Superstition peaks.</p>
<p>De Spain, without giving the weather signs
much thought, recognized their import, but his
mind was filled with his own anxieties and he
rode smartly back toward Calabasas, because he
was not at ease over the puzzles in the trail.
When he reached the depression where the horsemen
had, without any apparent reason, turned
south, he halted. Should he follow them or turn
north to follow Page&#8217;s wanderings? If Page had
been scared away from the Gap, for a time, he
probably had no information that de Spain wanted,
and de Spain knew his cunning and persistence
well enough to be confident he would be back on
the Gap road, and within the cover of the mountains,
before a storm should overtake him. On
the north the brown curtain had risen fast and
already enveloped the farthest peaks of the range.
Letting his horse stretch its neck, he hesitated a
moment longer trying to decide whether to follow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
the men to the south or the wagon to the
north. A woman might have done better. But
no good angel was there to guide his decision,
and in another moment he was riding rapidly to
the south with the even, brown, misty cloud behind
him rolling higher into the northern sky.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>DE SPAIN RIDES ALONE</h3>
</div>
<p>He had ridden the trail but a short time when
it led him in a wide angle backward and
around toward Calabasas, and he found, presently,
that the men he was riding after were apparently
heading for the stage barns. In the north the
rising curtain had darkened. Toward Sleepy Cat
the landscape was already obliterated. In the
south the sun shone, but the air had grown suddenly
cold, and in the sharp drop de Spain realized
what was coming. His first thought was of the
southern stages, which must be warned, and as
he galloped up to the big barn, with this thought
in mind he saw, standing in the doorway, Bull
Page.</p>
<p>De Spain regarded him with astonishment.
&#8220;How did you get here?&#8221; was his sharp question.</p>
<p>Page grinned. &#8220;Got what I was after, and c&#8217;m&#8217;
back sooner&#8217;n I expected. Half-way over to the
Gap, I met Duke and the young gal on horseback,
headed for Calabasas. They pulled up. I pulled
up. Old Duke looked kind o&#8217; ga&#8217;nted, and it
seemed like Nan was in a considerable hurry to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span>
get to Sleepy Cat with him, and he couldn&#8217;t stand
the saddle. Anyway, they was heading for Calabasas
to get a rig from McAlpin. I knowed McAlpin
would never give old Duke a rig, not if he
was a-dyin&#8217; in the saddle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got your rig!&#8221; cried de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gal asked me if I&#8217;d mind accommodatin&#8217;
&#8217;em,&#8221; explained Bull deprecatingly, &#8220;to save time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They headed north!&#8221; exclaimed de Spain.
The light from the fast-changing sky fell copper-colored
across his horse and figure. McAlpin,
followed by a hostler, appeared at the barn door.</p>
<p>Bull nodded to de Spain. &#8220;Said they wanted
to get there quick. She fig&#8217;erd on savin&#8217; a few
miles by strikin&#8217; the hill trail in. So I takes their
horses and lets on I was headin&#8217; in for the Gap.
When they got out of sight, I turned &#8217;round&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, the swift-rolling curtain of
mist overhead blotted the sun out of the sky.</p>
<p>De Spain sprang from his saddle with a ringing
order to McAlpin. &#8220;Get up a fresh saddle-horse!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A horse!&#8221; cried the startled barn boss, whirling
on the hostler. &#8220;The strongest legs in the
stable, and don&#8217;t lose a second! Lady Jane; up
with her!&#8221; he yelled, bellowing his orders into the
echoing barn with his hands to his mouth. &#8220;Up
with her for Mr. de Spain in a second! Marmon!
Becker! Lanzon! What in hell are you all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
doing?&#8221; he roared, rushing back with a fusillade
of oaths. &#8220;Look alive, everybody!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming!&#8221; yelled one voice after another
from the depths of the distant stalls.</p>
<p>De Spain ran into the office. Page caught his
horse, stripped the rifle from its holster, and
hurriedly began uncinching. Hostlers running
through the barn called shrilly back and forth,
and de Spain springing up the stairs to his room
provided what he wanted for his hurried flight.
When he dashed down with coats on his arm the
hoofs of Lady Jane were clattering down the long
gangway. A stable-boy slid from her back on
one side as Bull Page threw the saddle across her
from the other; hostlers caught at the cinches,
while others hurriedly rubbed the legs of the
quivering mare. De Spain, his hand on McAlpin&#8217;s
shoulder, was giving his parting injunctions,
and the barn boss, head cocked down, and eyes
cast furtively on the scattering snowflakes outside,
was listening with an attention that recorded
indelibly every uttered syllable.</p>
<p>Once only, he interrupted: &#8220;Henry, you&#8217;re
ridin&#8217; out into this thing alone&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; snapped de Spain impatiently,</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a man killer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob Scott, if he w&#8217;s here, &#8217;ud never let you do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
it. I&#8217;ll ride wi&#8217; ye myself, Henry. I worked for
your father&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too old a man, Jim&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Henry&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to me! Do as I tell you!&#8221; thundered
de Spain.</p>
<p>McAlpin bowed his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready!&#8221; yelled Page, buckling the rifle holster
in place. Still talking, and with McAlpin
glued to his elbow, de Spain vaulted into the saddle,
caught the lines from Bull&#8217;s hands, and
steadied the Lady as she sidestepped nervously&ndash;&ndash;McAlpin
following close and dodging the dancing
hoofs as he looked earnestly up to catch the
last word. De Spain touched the horse with the
lines. She leaped through the doorway and he
raised a backward hand to those behind. Running
outside the door, they yelled a chorus of
cries after the swift-moving horseman and, clustered
in an excited group, watched the Lady with
a dozen great strides round the Calabasas trail
and disappear with her rider into the whirling
snow.</p>
<p>She fell at once into an easy reaching step, and
de Spain, busy with his reflections, hardly gave
thought to what she was doing, and little more to
what was going on about him.</p>
<p>No moving figure reflects the impassive more
than a horseman of the mountains, on a long ride.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
Though never so swift-borne, the man, looking
neither to the right nor to the left, moving evenly
and statue-like against the sky, a part of the wiry
beast under him, presents the very picture of indifference
to the world around him. The great
swift wind spreading over the desert emptied on
it snow-laden puffs that whirled and wrapped a
cloud of flakes about horse and rider in the symbol
of a shroud. De Spain gave no heed to these
skirmishing eddies, but he knew what was behind
them, and for the wind, he only wished it might
keep the snow in the air till he caught sight of
Nan.</p>
<p>The even reach of the horse brought him to the
point where Nan had changed to the stage wagon.
Without a break in her long stride, Lady Jane
took the hint of her swerving rider, put her nose
into the wind, and headed north. De Spain,
alive to the difficulties of his venture, set his hat
lower and bent forward to follow the wagon along
the sand. With the first of the white flurries
passed, he found himself in a snowless pocket, as
it were, of the advancing storm. He hoped for
nothing from the prospect ahead; but every moment
of respite from the blinding whirl was a
gain, and with his eyes close on the trail that had
carried Nan into danger, he urged the Lady on.</p>
<p>When the snow again closed down about him
he calculated from the roughness of the country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
that he should be within a mile of the road that
Nan was trying to reach, from the Gap to Sleepy
Cat. But the broken ground straight ahead
would prevent her from driving directly to it.
He knew she must hold to the right, and her
curving track, now becoming difficult to trail,
confirmed his conclusion.</p>
<p>A fresh drive of the wind buffeted him as he
turned directly north. Only at intervals could he
see any trace of the wagon wheels. The driving
snow compelled him more than once to dismount
and search for the trail. Each time he lost it
the effort to regain it was more prolonged. At
times he was compelled to ride the desert in wide
circles to find the tracks, and this cost time when
minutes might mean life. But as long as he could
he clung to the struggle to track her exactly.
He saw almost where the storm had struck the
two wayfarers. Neither, he knew, was insensible
to its dangers. What amazed him was that
a man like Duke Morgan should be out in it.
He found a spot where they had halted and, with
a start that checked the beating of his heart, his
eyes fell on her footprint not yet obliterated,
beside the wagon track.</p>
<p>The sight of it was an electric shock. Throwing
himself from his horse, he knelt over it in the
storm, oblivious for an instant of everything but
that this tracery meant her presence, where he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span>
now bent, hardly half an hour before. He swung,
after a moment&#8217;s keen scrutiny, into his saddle,
with fresh resolve. Pressed by the rising fury of
the wind, the wayfarers had become from this
point, de Spain saw too plainly, hardly more than
fugitives. Good ground to the left, where their
hope of safety lay, had been overlooked. Their
tracks wandered on the open desert like those
who, losing courage, lose their course in the confusion
and fear of the impending peril.</p>
<p>And with this increasing uncertainty in their
direction vanished de Spain&#8217;s last hopes of tracking
them. The wind swept the desert now as a
hurricane sweeps the open sea, snatching the
fallen snow from the face of the earth as the sea-gale,
flattening the face of the waters, rips the
foam from the frantic waves to drive it in wild,
scudding fragments across them.</p>
<p>De Spain, urging his horse forward, unbuckled
his rifle holster, threw away the scabbard, and
holding the weapon up in one hand, fired shot
after shot at measured intervals to attract the
attention of the two he sought. He exhausted
his rifle ammunition without eliciting any answer.
The wind drove with a roar against which even
a rifle report could hardly carry, and the snow
swept down the Sinks in a mad blast. Flakes
torn by the fury of the gale were stiffened by the
bitter wind into powdered ice that stung horse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_405' name='page_405'></a>405</span>
and rider. Casting away the useless carbine,
and pressing his horse to the limit of her strength
and endurance, the unyielding pursuer rode in
great coiling circles into the storm, to cut in, if
possible, ahead of its victims, firing shot upon
shot from his revolver, and putting his ear intently
against the wind for the faint hope of an
answer.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Lady stumbled and, as he cruelly
reined her, slid helpless and scrambling along the
face of a flat rock. De Spain, leaping from her
back, steadied her trembling and looked underfoot.
The mare had struck the rock of the upper
lava bed. Drawing his revolver, he fired signal
shots from where he stood. It could not be far, he
knew, from the junction of the two great desert
trails&ndash;&ndash;the Calabasas road and the Gap road.
He felt sure Nan could not have got much north
of this, for he had ridden in desperation to get
abreast of or beyond her, and if she were south,
where, he asked, in the name of God, could she
be?</p>
<p>He climbed again into the saddle&ndash;&ndash;the cold was
gripping his limbs&ndash;&ndash;and, watching the rocky landmarks
narrowly, tried to circle the dead waste
of the half-buried flow. With chilled, awkward
fingers he filled the revolver again and rode on,
discharging it every minute, and listening&ndash;&ndash;hoping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_406' name='page_406'></a>406</span>
against hope for an answer. It was when he
had almost completed, as well as he could compute,
the wide circuit he had set out on, that
a faint shot answered his continuing signals.</p>
<p>With the sound of that shot and those that followed
it his courage all came back. But he had
yet to trace through the confusion of the wind and
the blinding snow the direction of the answering
reports.</p>
<p>Hither and thither he rode, this way and that,
testing out the location of the slowly repeated
shots, and signalling at intervals in return.
Slowly and doggedly he kept on, shooting, listening,
wheeling, and advancing until, as he raised
his revolver to fire it again, a cry close at hand
came out of the storm. It was a woman&#8217;s voice
borne on the wind. Riding swiftly to the left, a
horse&#8217;s outline revealed itself at moments in the
driving snow ahead.</p>
<p>De Spain cried out, and from behind the furious
curtain heard his name, loudly called. He
pushed his stumbling horse on. The dim outline
of a second horse, the background of a wagon,
a storm-beaten man&ndash;&ndash;all this passed his eyes unheeded.
They were bent on a girlish figure running
toward him as he slid stiffly from the saddle.
The next instant Nan was in his arms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>THE TRUTH</h3>
</div>
<p>With the desperation of a joy born of despair
she laid her burning cheek hysterically
against his cheek. She rained kisses on his
ice-crusted brows and snow-beaten eyes. Her
arms held him rigidly. He could not move nor
speak till she would let him. Transformed, this
mountain girl who gave herself so shyly, forgot
everything. Her words crowded on his ears.
She repeated his name in an ecstasy of welcome,
drew down his lips, laughed, rejoiced, knew no
shamefacedness and no restraint&ndash;&ndash;she was one
freed from the stroke of a descending knife. A
moment before she had faced death alone; it was
still death she faced&ndash;&ndash;she realized this&ndash;&ndash;but it
was death, at least, together, and her joy and
tears rose from her heart in one stream.</p>
<p>De Spain comforted her, quieted her, cut away
one of the coats from his horse, slipped it over
her shoulders, incased her in the heavy fur, and
turned his eyes to Duke.</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s set, square face surrendered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_408' name='page_408'></a>408</span>
nothing of implacability to the dangers confronting
him. De Spain looked for none of that. He
had known the Morgan record too long, and
faced the Morgan men too often, to fancy they
would flinch at the drum-beat of death.</p>
<p>The two men, in the deadly, driving snow, eyed
each other. Out of the old man&#8217;s deep-set eyes
burned the resistance of a hundred storms faced
before. But he was caught now like a wolf in a
trap, and he knew he had little to hope for, little
to fear. As de Spain regarded him, something
like pity may have mixed with his hatred. The
old outlaw was thinly clad. His open throat was
beaten with snow and, standing beside the wagon,
he held the team reins in a bare hand. De Spain
cut the other coat from his saddle and held it
out. Duke pretended not to see and, when not
longer equal to keeping up the pretense, shook
his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it,&#8221; said de Spain curtly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it, I say. You and I will settle our
affairs when we get Nan out of this,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;De Spain!&#8221; Duke&#8217;s voice, as was its wont,
cracked like a pistol, &#8220;I can say all I&#8217;ve got to say
to you right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; cried the old man.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_409' name='page_409'></a>409</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Henry,&#8221; pleaded Nan, seeking shelter
from the furious blast within his arm, &#8220;just for
a moment, listen!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, I tell you!&#8221; cried de Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was coming, Henry, all the way&ndash;&ndash;and he
is sick&ndash;&ndash;just to say it to you. Let him say it
here, now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; cried de Spain roughly. &#8220;Say it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of you, de Spain!&#8221; shouted the
old man, his neck bared to the flying ice. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
think it! You&#8217;re a better man than I am, better
than I ever was&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t know that.
But I&#8217;m not afraid of e&#8217;er a man I faced, de Spain;
they&#8217;ll tell you that when I&#8217;m dead. All the
trouble that ever come &#8217;tween you and me come
by an accident&ndash;&ndash;come before you was born, and
come through Dave Sassoon, and he&#8217;s held it over
me ever since you come up into this country. I
was a young fellow. Sassoon worked for my
father. The cattle and sheep war was on, north
of Medicine Bend. The Peace River sheepmen
raided our place&ndash;&ndash;your father was with them.
He never did us no harm, but my brother, Bay
Morgan, was shot in that raid by a man name of
Jennings. My brother was fifteen years old, de
Spain. I started out to get the man that shot
him. Sassoon trailed him to the Bar M, the
old de Spain ranch, working for your father.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_410' name='page_410'></a>410</span></div>
<p>The words fell fast and in a fury. They came
as if they had been choked back till they strangled.
&#8220;Sassoon took me over there. Toward night we
got in sight of the ranch-house. We saw a man
down at the corral. &#8216;That&#8217;s Jennings,&#8217; Sassoon
says. I never laid eyes on him before&ndash;&ndash;I never
laid eyes on your father before. Both of us fired.
Next day we heard your father was killed, and
Jennings had left the country. Sassoon or I, one
of us, killed your father, de Spain. If it was I,
I did it never knowing who he was, never meaning
to touch him. I was after the man that killed
my brother. Sassoon didn&#8217;t care a damn which
it was, never did, then nor never. But he held
it over me to make trouble sometime &#8217;twixt you
and me. I was a young fellow. I thought I was
revenging my brother. And if your father was
killed by a patched bullet, his blood is not on me,
de Spain, and never was. Sassoon always shot
a patched bullet. I never shot one in my life.
And I&#8217;d never told you this of my own self. Nan
said it was the whole truth from me to you, or
her life. She&#8217;s as much mine as she is yours. I
nursed her. I took care of her when there weren&#8217;t
no other living soul to do it. <i>She got me and herself
out into this, this morning. I&#8217;d never been
caught like this if I&#8217;d had my way.</i> I told her &#8217;fore
we&#8217;d been out an hour we&#8217;d never see the end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_411' name='page_411'></a>411</span>
it. She said she&#8217;d rather die in it than you&#8217;d
think she quit you. I told her I&#8217;d go on with
her and do as she said&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re here,
and that&#8217;s the whole truth, so help me God!</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t afraid of you, de Spain. I&#8217;ll give you
whatever you think&#8217;s coming to you with a rifle
or a gun any time, anywhere&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;re a better man
than I am or ever was, I know that&ndash;&ndash;and that
ought to satisfy you. Or, I&#8217;ll stand my trial, if
you say so, and tell the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ice-laden wind, as de Spain stood still,
swept past the little group with a sinister roar,
insensible alike to its emotions and its deadly
peril. Within the shelter of his arm he felt the
yielding form of the indomitable girl who, by the
power of love, had wrung from the outlaw his
reluctant story&ndash;&ndash;the story of the murder that
had stained with its red strands the relations of
each of their lives to both the others. He felt
against his heart the faint trembling of her frail
body. So, when a boy, he had held in his hand a
fluttering bird and felt the whirring beat of its
frightened heart against his strong, cruel fingers.</p>
<p>A sudden aversion to more bloodshed, a sickening
of vengeance, swept over him as her heart
mutely beat for mercy against his heart. She
had done more than any man could do. Now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_412' name='page_412'></a>412</span>
her. In the breathless embrace that drew her
closer she read her answer from him. She looked
up into his eyes and waited. &#8220;There&#8217;s more than
what&#8217;s between you and me, Duke, facing us
now,&#8221; said de Spain sternly, when he turned.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to get Nan out of this&ndash;&ndash;even if we
don&#8217;t get out ourselves. Where do you figure
we are?&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I figure we&#8217;re two miles north of the lava
beds, de Spain,&#8221; shouted Morgan.</p>
<p>De Spain shook his head in dissent. &#8220;Then
where are we?&#8221; demanded the older man rudely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought not to say, against you. But if I&#8217;ve
got to guess, I say two miles east. Either way,
we must try for Sleepy Cat. Is your team all
right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Team is all right. We tore a wheel near off
getting out of the lava. The wagon&#8217;s done for.&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain threw the fur coat at him. &#8220;Put it
on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll look at the wheel.&#8221;</p>
<p>They tried together to wrench it into shape,
but worked without avail. In the end they
lashed it, put Nan on the Lady, and walked behind
while the team pushed into the pitiless wind.
Morgan wanted to cut the wagon away and take
to the horses, but de Spain said, not till they
found a trail or the stage road.</p>
<p>So much snow had fallen that in spite of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_413' name='page_413'></a>413</span>
blizzard, driving with an unrelenting fury, the
drifts were deepening, packing, and making all
effort increasingly difficult. It was well-nigh impossible
to head the horses into the storm, and de
Spain looked with ever more anxious eyes at Nan.
After half an hour&#8217;s superhuman struggle to regain
a trail that should restore their bearings,
they halted, and de Spain, riding up to the wagon,
spoke to Morgan, who was driving: &#8220;How long
is this going to last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All day and all night.&#8221; Nan leaned closely
over to hear the curt question and answer. Neither
man spoke again for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to have help,&#8221; said de Spain after
a pause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help?&#8221; echoed Morgan scornfully. &#8220;Where&#8217;s
help coming from?&#8221;</p>
<p>De Spain&#8217;s answer was not hurried. &#8220;One of
us must go after it.&#8221; Nan looked at him intently.</p>
<p>Duke set his hard jaw against the hurtling
stream of ice that showered on the forlorn party.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll go for it,&#8221; he snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned de Spain. &#8220;Better for me to
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go together,&#8221; said Nan.</p>
<p>De Spain shook his head. Duke Morgan, too,
said that only one should go; the other must
stay. De Spain, while the storm rattled and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_414' name='page_414'></a>414</span>
shook at the two men, told why he should go
himself. &#8220;It&#8217;s not claiming you are not entitled
to say who should go, Duke,&#8221; he said evenly.
&#8220;Nor that our men, anywhere you reach, wouldn&#8217;t
give you the same attention they would me.
And it isn&#8217;t saying that you&#8217;re not the better man
for the job&ndash;&ndash;you&#8217;ve travelled the Sinks longer
than I have. But between you and me, Duke,
it&#8217;s twenty-eight years against fifty. I ought to
hold out a while the longer, that&#8217;s all. Let&#8217;s
work farther to the east.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quartering against the mad hurricane, they
drove and rode on until the team could hardly be
urged to further effort against the infuriated elements&ndash;&ndash;de
Spain riding at intervals as far to the
right and the left as he dared in vain quest of a
landmark. When he halted beside the wagon for
the last time he was a mass of snow and ice; horse
and rider were frozen to each other. He got down
to the ground with a visible effort, and in the
singing wind told Duke his plan and purpose.</p>
<p>He had chosen on the open desert a hollow falling
somewhat abruptly from the north, and beneath
its shoulder, while Morgan loosened the
horses, he scooped and kicked away a mass of
snow. The wagon had been drawn just above
the point of refuge, and the two men, with the aid
of the wind, dumped it over sidewise, making of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_415' name='page_415'></a>415</span>
the body a windbreak over the hollow, a sort of
roof, around which the snow, driven by the gale,
would heap itself in hard waves. Within this
shelter the men stowed Nan. The horses were
driven down behind it, and from one of them de
Spain took the collar, the tugs, and the whiffletree.
He stuck a hitching-strap in his pocket,
and while Morgan steadied the Lady&#8217;s head, de
Spain buckled the collar on her, doubled the tugs
around the whiffletree, and fastened the roll at
her side in front of the saddle.</p>
<p>Nan came out and stood beside him as he
worked. When he had finished she put her hand
on his sleeve. He held her close, Duke listening,
to tell her what he meant to try to do. Each
knew it well might be the last moment together.
&#8220;One thing and another have kept us from marriage
vows, Nan,&#8221; said de Spain, beckoning at
length to Morgan to step closer that he might
clearly hear. &#8220;Nothing must keep us longer.
Will you marry me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up into his eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ve promised
you I would. I will promise every time you ask
me. I never <i>could</i> have but one answer to that,
Henry&ndash;&ndash;it must always be yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then take me, Henry,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;here
and now for your wedded husband. Will you do
this, Nan?&#8221;</p>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_417' name='page_417'></a>417</span></div>
<p>Still looking into his eyes, she answered without
surprise or fear: &#8220;Henry, I do take you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I, Henry, take you, Nan, here and now
for my wedded wife, for better for worse, for richer
for poorer, from this day forward, until death us
do part.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sealed their pact with a silent embrace.
De Spain turned to Duke. &#8220;You are the witness
of this marriage, Duke. You will see, if an accident
happens, that anything, everything I have&ndash;&ndash;some
personal property&ndash;&ndash;my father&#8217;s old ranch
north of Medicine Bend&ndash;&ndash;some little money in
bank at Sleepy Cat&ndash;&ndash;goes to my wife, Nan Morgan
de Spain. Will you see to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will. And if it comes to me&ndash;&ndash;you, de Spain,
will see to it that what stock I have in the Gap
goes to my niece, Nan, your wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked from one to the other of the two
men. &#8220;All that I have,&#8221; she said in turn, &#8220;the
lands in the Gap, everywhere around Music
Mountain, go to you two equally together, or
whichever survives. And if you both live, and
I do not, remember my last message&ndash;&ndash;bury the
past in my grave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Duke Morgan tested the cinches of the saddle
on the Lady once more, unloosed the tugs once
more from the horse&#8217;s shoulder, examined each
buckle of the collar and every inch of the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_418' name='page_418'></a>418</span>
strips of leather, the reinforced fastenings on the
whiffletree, rolled all up again, strapped it, and
stood by the head till de Spain swung up into
the saddle. He bent down once to whisper a
last word of cheer to his wife and, without looking
back, headed the Lady into the storm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>GAMBLING WITH DEATH</h3>
</div>
<p>Beyond giving his horse a safe headway from
the shelter, de Spain made little effort to
guide her. He had chosen the Lady, not because
she was fresher, for she was not, but because he
believed she possessed of the three horses the
clearest instinct to bring her through the fight
for the lives that were at stake. He did not deceive
himself with the idea he could do anything
to help the beast find a way to succor; that instinct
rested wholly in the Lady&#8217;s head, not in
his. He only knew that if she could not get back
to help, he could not. His own part in the effort
was quite outside any aid to the Lady&ndash;&ndash;it was no
more than to reach alive whatever aid she could
find, that he might direct it to where Nan and her
companion would endure a few hours longer the
fury of the storm.</p>
<p>His own struggle for life, he realized, was with
the wind&ndash;&ndash;the roaring wind that hurled its broadsides
of frozen snow in monstrous waves across
the maddened sky, challenging every living thing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_420' name='page_420'></a>420</span>
It drove icy knives into his face and ears, paralyzed
in its swift grasp his muscles and sinews,
fought the stout flow of blood through his veins,
and searched his very heart to still it.</p>
<p>Encouraging the Lady with kind words, and
caressing her in her groping efforts as she turned
head and tail from the blinding sheets of snow and
ice, de Spain let her drift, hoping she might bring
them through, what he confessed in his heart to
be, the narrowest of chances.</p>
<p>He bent low in his saddle under the unending
blasts. He buffeted his legs and arms to fight
off the fatal cold. He slipped more than once
from his seat, and with a hand on the pommel
tramped beside the horse to revive his failing
circulation; there would come a time, he realized,
when he could no longer climb up again, but he
staved that issue off to the last possible moment
of endurance, because the Lady made better time
when he was on her back. When the struggle to
remount had been repeated until nature could
no longer by any staggering effort be made to
respond to his will, until his legs were no longer a
part of his benumbed being&ndash;&ndash;until below his hips
he had no body answerable to his commands, but
only two insensible masses of lead that anchored
him to the ground&ndash;&ndash;he still forced the frozen feet
to carry him, in a feeble, monstrous gait beside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_421' name='page_421'></a>421</span>
the Lady, while he dragged with his hands on the
saddle for her patient aid.</p>
<p>One by one every thought, as if congealed in
their brain cells, deserted his mind&ndash;&ndash;save the
thought that he must not freeze to death. More
than once he had hoped the insensate fury of
the blizzard might abate. The Lady had long
since ceased to try to face it&ndash;&ndash;like a stripped
vessel before a hurricane, she was drifting under
it. De Spain realized that his helpless legs would
not carry him farther. His hands, freezing to
the pommel, no longer supported him. They
finally slipped from it and he fell prostrate in the
snow beside his horse. When he would cry out
to her his frozen lips could mumble no words.
It was the fight no longer of a man against nature,
but only of an indomitable soul against a cruel,
hateful death. He struggled to his feet only to
fall again more heavily. He pulled himself up
this time by the stirrup-strap, got his hands and
arms up to the pommel, and clung to it for a few
paces more. But he fell at last, and could no
longer rise from the ground. The storm swept
unceasingly on.</p>
<p>The Lady, checked by the lines wrapped on
his arm, stopped. De Spain lay a moment, then
backed her up a step, pulled her head down by
the bridle, clasped his wooden arms around her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_422' name='page_422'></a>422</span>
neck, spoke to her and, lifting her head, the mare
dragged him to his feet. Clumsily and helplessly
he loosened the tugs and the whiffletree, beat his
hands together with idiotic effort, hooked the
middle point of the whiffletree into the elbow of
his left arm, brought the forearm and hand up
flat against his shoulder, and with the hitching-strap
lashed his forearm and upper arm tightly
together around the whiffletree.</p>
<p>He drew the tugs stiffly over the Lady&#8217;s back,
unloosed the cinches of the saddle, pushed it off
the horse and, sinking into the snow behind her,
struck with his free arm at her feet. Relieved of
the saddle, the Lady once more started, dragging
slowly behind her through the snow a still breathing
human being. Less than an hour before it
had been a man. It was hardly more now, as
the Lady plodded on, than an insensate log.
But not even death could part it again from the
horse to which de Spain, alive, had fastened it.</p>
<p>The fearful pain from the tortured arm, torn
at times almost from its socket, the gradual snapping
of straining ligaments, the constant rupture
of capillaries and veins sustained his consciousness
for a while. Then the torturing pain abated,
the rough dragging shattered the bruised body less.
It was as if the Lady and the storm together were
making easier for the slowly dying man his last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_423' name='page_423'></a>423</span>
trail across the desert. He still struggled to keep
alive, by sheer will-power, flickering sparks of
consciousness, and to do so concentrated every
thought on Nan. It was a poignant happiness
to summon her picture to his fainting senses; he
knew he should hold to life as long as he could
think of her. Love, stronger than death, welled
in his heart. The bitter cold and the merciless
wind were kinder as he called her image from
out of the storm. She seemed to speak&ndash;&ndash;to lift
him in her arms. Ahead, distant mountains rose,
white-peaked. The sun shone. He rode with her
through green fields, and a great peace rested on
his weary senses.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Lady Jane, pushing on and on, enlightened by
that instinct before which the reason of man is
weak and pitiful, seeing, as it were, through the
impenetrable curtain of the storm where refuge
lay, herself a slow-moving crust of frozen snow,
dragged to her journey&#8217;s end&ndash;&ndash;to the tight-shut
doors of the Calabasas barn&ndash;&ndash;her unconscious
burden, and stood before them patiently waiting
until some one should open for her. It was one
of the heartbreaks of a tragic day that no one
ever knew just when the Lady reached the door
or how long she and her unconscious master waited
in the storm for admission. A startled exclamation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_424' name='page_424'></a>424</span>
from John Lefever, who had periodically and
anxiously left the red-hot stove in the office to
walk moodily to the window, brought the men
tumbling over one another as he ran from his
companions to throw open the outer door and pull
the drooping horse into the barn.</p>
<p>It was the Indian, Scott, who, reading first of
all the men everything in the dread story, sprang
forward with a stifled exclamation, as the horse
dragged in the snow-covered log, whipped a knife
from his pocket, cut the incumbered arm and
white hand free from the whiffletree and, carrying
the stiffened body into the office, began with insane
haste to cut away the clothing.</p>
<p>Lefever, perceiving it was de Spain thus drawn
to their feet, shouted, while he tore from the
blade of Scott&#8217;s knife the frozen garments, the
orders for the snow, the heated water, the warm
blankets, the alcohol and brandy, and, stripped to
his waist, chafed the marble feet. The Indian,
better than a staff of doctors, used the cunning
of a sorcerer to revive the spark of inanimate life
not yet extinguished by the storm. A fearful
interval of suspense followed the silence into
which the work settled, a silence broken only
by the footsteps of men running to and from the
couch over which Scott, Lefever, and McAlpin,
half-naked, worked in mad concert.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_425' name='page_425'></a>425</span></div>
<p>De Spain opened his eyes to wander from one
to the other of the faces. He half rose up, struggling
in a frenzy with the hands that restrained
him. While his companions pleaded to quiet
him, he fought them until, restored to its seat of
reason, his mind reasserted itself and, lying exhausted,
he told them in his exquisite torture of
whom he had left, and what must be done to find
and bring them in.</p>
<p>While the relief wagons, equipped with straining
teams and flanked by veteran horsemen, were
dashing out of the barn, he lapsed into unconsciousness.
But he had been able to hold Scott&#8217;s
hand long enough to tell him he must find
Nan and bring her in, or never come back.</p>
<p>It was Scott who found her. In their gropings
through the blizzard the three had wandered
nearer Calabasas than any one of them dreamed.
And on the open desert, far south and east of the
upper lava beds, it was Scott&#8217;s horse that put a
foot through the bottom of the overturned wagon
box. The suspected mound of snow, with the
buried horses scrambling to their feet, rose upright
at the crash. Duke crouched, half-conscious,
under the rude shelter. Lying where he
had placed her, snugly between the horses, Scott
found Nan. He spoke to her when she opened
her staring eyes, picked her up in his arms, called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_426' name='page_426'></a>426</span>
to his companions for the covered wagon, and began
to restore her, without a moment of delay, to
life. He even promised if she would drink the
hateful draft he put to her lips and let him cut
away her shoes and leggings and the big coat
frozen on her, that in less than an hour she should
see Henry de Spain alive and well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>AT SLEEPY CAT</h3>
</div>
<p>Nothing in nature, not even the storm itself,
is so cruel as the beauty of the after
calm. In the radiance of the sunshine next day
de Spain, delirious and muttering, was taken to
the hospital at Sleepy Cat. In an adjoining room
lay Nan, moaning reproaches at those who were
torturing her reluctantly back to life. Day and
night the doctors worked over the three. The
town, the division, the stagemen, and the mountain-men
watched the outcome of the struggle.
From as far as Medicine Bend railroad surgeons
came to aid in the fight.</p>
<p>De Spain cost the most acute anxiety. The
crux of the battle, after the three lives were held
safe, centred on the effort to save de Spain&#8217;s arm&ndash;&ndash;the
one he had chosen to lose, if he must lose
one, when he strapped it to the whiffletree. The
day the surgeons agreed that if his life were to be
saved the arm must come off at the shoulder a
gloom fell on the community.</p>
<p>In a lifetime of years there can come to the
greater part of us but a few days, a few hours,
sometimes no more than a single moment, to show
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_428' name='page_428'></a>428</span>
of what stuff we are really made. Such a crisis
came that day to Nan. Already she had been
wheeled more than once into de Spain&#8217;s room, to
sit where she could help to woo him back to life.
The chief surgeon, in the morning, told Nan of
the decision. In her hospital bed she rose bolt
upright. &#8220;No!&#8221; she declared solemnly. &#8220;You
shan&#8217;t take his arm off!&#8221;</p>
<p>The surgeon met her rebellion tactfully. But
he told Nan, at last, that de Spain must lose either
his arm or his life. &#8220;No,&#8221; she repeated without
hesitation and without blanching, &#8220;you shan&#8217;t
take off his arm. He shan&#8217;t lose his life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The blood surged into her cheeks&ndash;&ndash;better blood
and redder than the doctors had been able to
bring there&ndash;&ndash;such blood as de Spain alone could
call into them. Nan, with her nurse&#8217;s help,
dressed, joined de Spain, and talked long and
earnestly. The doctors, too, laid the situation
before him. When they asked him for his decision,
he nodded toward Nan. &#8220;She will tell
you, gentlemen, what we&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Nan did tell them what the two who had
most at stake in the decision would do. Any
man could have done as much as that. But Nan
did more. She set herself out to save the arm
and patient both, and, lest the doctors should
change their tactics and move together on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_429' name='page_429'></a>429</span>
arm surreptitiously, Nan stayed night and day
with de Spain, until he was able to make such active
use of either arm as to convince her that he,
and not the surgeons, would soon need the most
watching.</p>
<p>Afterward when Nan, in some doubt, asked the
chaplain whether she was married or single, he
obligingly offered to ratify and confirm the desert
ceremony.</p>
<p>This affair was the occasion for an extraordinary
round-up at Sleepy Cat. Two long-hostile elements&ndash;&ndash;the
stage and railroad men and the Calabasas-Morgan
Gap contingent of mountain-men,
for once at least, fraternized. Warrants were
pigeonholed, suspicion suspended, side-arms neglected
in their scabbards. The fighting men of
both camps, in the presence of a ceremony that
united de Spain and Nan Morgan, could not but
feel a generous elation. Each party considered
that it was contributing to the festivity in the
bride and the groom the very best each could
boast, and no false note disturbed the harmony
of the notable day.</p>
<p>Gale Morgan, having given up the fight, had
left the country. Satterlee Morgan danced till
all the platforms in town gave way. John Lefever
attended the groom, and Duke Morgan
sternly, but without compunction, gave the bride.

From Medicine Bend, Farrell Kennedy brought a
notable company of de Spain&#8217;s early associates
for the event. It included Whispering Smith,
whose visit to Sleepy Cat on this occasion was the
first in years; George McCloud, who had come
all the way from Omaha to join his early comrades
in arms; Wickwire, who had lost none of
his taciturn bluntness&ndash;&ndash;and so many train-despatchers
that the service on the division was
crippled for the entire day.</p>
<p>A great company of self-appointed retainers
gathered together from over all the country, rode
behind the gayly decorated bridal-coach in procession
from the church to Jeffries&#8217;s house, where the
feasts had been prepared. During the reception
a modest man, dragged from an obscure corner
among the guests, was made to take his place
next Lefever on the receiving-line. It was Bob
Scott, and he looked most uncomfortable until he
found a chance to slip unobserved back to the
side of the room where the distinguished Medicine
Bend contingent, together with McAlpin, Pardaloe,
Elpaso, and Bull Page, slightly unsteady,
but extremely serious for the grave occasion,
appeared vastly uncomfortable together.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The railroad has not yet been built across the
Sinks to Thief River. But only those who lived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_431' name='page_431'></a>431</span>
in Sleepy Cat in its really wild stage days are
entitled to call themselves early settlers, or to tell
stories more or less authentic about what then
happened. The greater number of the Old
Guard of that day, as cankering peace gradually
reasserted itself along the Sinks, turned from the
stage coach to the railroad coach; some of them
may yet be met on the trains in the mountain
country. Wherever you happen to find such a
one, he will tell you of the days when Superintendent
de Spain of the Western Division wore a
gun in the mountains and used it, when necessary,
on his wife&#8217;s relations.</p>
<p>Whether it was this stern sense of discipline or
not that endeared him to the men, these old-timers
are, to a man, very loyal to the young
couple who united in their marriage the two
hostile mountain elements. One in especial, a
white-haired old man, described by the fanciful as
a retired outlaw, living yet on Nan&#8217;s ranch in the
Gap, always spends his time in town at the de
Spain home, where he takes great interest in an
active little boy, Morgan de Spain, who waits for
his Uncle Duke&#8217;s coming, and digs into his pockets
for rattles captured along the trail from recent
huge rattlesnakes. When his uncle happens to
kill a big one&ndash;&ndash;one with twelve or thirteen rings
and a button&ndash;&ndash;Morgan uses it to scare his younger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_432' name='page_432'></a>432</span>
sister, Nan. And Duke, secretly rejoicing at his
bravado, but scolding sharply, helps him adjust
the old ammunition-belt dragged from the attic,
and cuts fresh gashes in it to make it fit the childish
waist. His mother doesn&#8217;t like to see her son
in warlike equipment, ambushing little Nan in
the way Bob Scott says the Indians used to do.
She threatens periodically to burn the belt up
and throw the old rifles out of the house. But
when she sees her uncle and her husband watching
the boy and laughing at the parade together,
she relents. It is only children, after all, that
keep the world young.</p>
